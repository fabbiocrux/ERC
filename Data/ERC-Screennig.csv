"ref_001","SMADBINS","Smart Dust Batteries Integrated with Near-Zero-Power Surveillance","The lack of an on-chip power source providing uninterrupted energy impedes the progress of smart dust in moving from lab-level demonstrations to everyday applications. Tiny generators relying on external energy sources face spatial and temporal limitations. Batteries with adequate energy are not available in an area of less than 1 mm2, and the reasons for their absence are manifold. Mainstream battery architectures require either thick or tall electrodes created by etching into the wafer, but it is very fiddly to deposit materials onto these electrodes without defects. High-capacity materials such as lithium cobalt oxide, sulfur and lithium metal are often excluded because on-chip techniques to synthesize or stabilize such materials are missing. Moreover, a low-power monitor to provide precise information about the energy storage state and battery health is essential for real applications but unexplored so far. These difficulties demand a paradigm shift in microbattery development to pursue novel approaches that offer energy-dense microbatteries integrable into microsystems. Therefore, we propose a micro-origami technology for on-chip microbatteries using aqueous zinc battery chemistry, together with embedded surveillance based on a non-volatile redox transistor with near-zero power consumption. SMADBINS is expected to bring advances in battery chemistry and materials and on-chip energy production and management, boosting research for microbattery and smart dust applications, as was recently highlighted by the PI [Nature, 2021, 589, 195]. The PI has decisively contributed to the field of aqueous microbatteries and developed the smart dust battery concept together with his team in several publications. However, a smart dust battery has not been achieved yet. Therefore, the main objective of this project is to develop the first smart dust battery embedded with a low-power monitor, which attains a footprint capacity of more than 10 mAh/cm2 within 1 mm2.","ZHU Minshen",2021,1498624,"Chemnitz University of Technology","excluded",NA
"ref_002","ACC-3D","Auxetic Cementitious Composites by 3D Printing","Concrete is inherently brittle. This is a problem because important structures such as nuclear power plants need ductility to remain functional after earthquakes and impacts. ACC-3D aims at creating novel, ductile cementitious composites by using local reinforcement with an unusual quality, negative Poisson's ratio, known as auxetics. Currently, steel rebars or fibers are used to make concrete ductile. Such reinforcement is only active once the concrete has cracked: it prevents existing cracks from growing. Cracking might leave structures unfunctional or vulnerable to repeated events and aftershocks. Can we make reinforcement actively work with concrete already before cracking by making it auxetic? This has never been attempted before. Emerging auxetics with complex architectures fabricated by 3D printing offer excellent energy absorption capacity. However, they have low stiffness which makes them unsuitable for structural applications. I believe that using auxetics as reinforcement in cementitious composites will result in energy absorption at least 2 times higher than current approaches without impairing the stiffness. Through a preliminary study I discovered that auxetics can outperform conventional reinforcement in cementitious composites in terms of flexural strength and energy absorption. However, the mechanism of interaction between deformable auxetic reinforcement and the stiff cementitious matrix is unknown. In ACC-3D I aim to fundamentally understand and fully exploit the potential of auxetic cementitious composites by combining design, experiments, and numerical modelling. This will allow me to create innovative cementitious composites with high ductility and energy absorption capacity. The approach developed in ACC-3D will open possibilities for development of designer construction materials, allowing mechanical response of building materials to be tuned through purposefully adjusting their material architecture.","ŠAVIJA Branko",2021,1498201,"Delft University of Technology","selected",NA
"ref_003","FAIR-RFB","Engineered Porous Electrodes to Unlock Ultra-low Cost Fe-Air Redox Flow Batteries","This proposal will develop a game-changing paradigm to design, synthesize, and functionalize porous electrode materials with far-reaching consequences in electrochemical science and engineering. Focusing on the Fe-air redox flow battery (FAIR-RFB), which holds promise for low-cost, long duration energy storage, I will employ an interdisciplinary approach bridging (electro)chemical engineering, materials science, and computational design to address the following fundamental challenges: (1) I will elucidate the role of the porous electrode microstructure. I will introduce a new methodology that couples evolutionary algorithms with microstructure-informed simulations to predict ideal electrode geometries. A versatile synthetic platform, non-solvent induced phase separation, will be leveraged to synthesize highly controlled 3D microstructures and train neural networks to accelerate the discovery of optimal geometries. (2) I will determine to what extent surface moieties of the porous electrode influence transport phenomena, kinetics, and durability. I will employ electrografting of select molecules to functionalize porous electrodes and impart functional properties (wettability, activity, stability). I will perform nanoelectrochemical imaging to elucidate the role of electrode-coating-electrolyte phenomena. (3) I will develop a novel electrochemical reactor architecture for high-power Fe-air RFBs. Building upon the two previous developments, I will synthesize tailored iron and air electrodes and leverage polymeric bipolar membranes to realize a high voltage and low resistance electrochemical cell. Advanced imaging techniques, i.e. energy- and wavelength-selective neutron imaging, will be employed to visualize reactive transport phenomena during operation, thus helping to address these questions. The novel approaches developed in FAIR-RFB will enable breakthroughs in performance and durability of large-scale electrochemical energy storage systems.","FORNER-CUENCA Antoni",2021,1999958,"Eindhoven University of Technology","excluded",NA
"ref_004","RACER","Highly Redox-active Atomic Centers in Electrode Materials for Rechargeable Batteries","Lithium-ion batteries are the state-of-the-art electrochemical energy storage technology, sodium-ion batteries are about to become commercial, and potassium-ion batteries are attracting rapidly increasing interest. All these alkali-ion battery (AIB) technologies, especially the already or soon-to-be commercialized battery chemistries, have one common characteristic making them so successful – the use of insertion-type electrode materials. These materials provide sufficient space in their crystal structure for the alkali ions to be reversibly inserted, without causing substantial (irreversible) rearrangement. However, the fact that the ions can only occupy specific sites in the host lattice intrinsically limits the amount of ions that can be reversibly inserted. The aim of this project is the development of a new family of electrode materials for AIBs, which is characterized by an innovative storage mechanism. This mechanism combines the benefits of a stable insertion-type host structure with an extended redox activity and additional available space for the alkali-ion charge carriers resulting from the introduction of carefully selected atomic redox centres (ARCs). Based on own preliminary results and new yet to be developed suitable host matrices and ARCs, and their comprehensive investigation by highly complementary ex/in situ and operando characterization techniques to gain an in-depth understanding of this new mechanism, we will develop specific guidelines and design criteria for the realization of such novel materials. These criteria and guidelines will be effectively evaluated by designing new materials which benefit of this new charge storage mechanism and, thus, enable long-term stable insertion-type AIBs with enhanced energy and power densities. Moreover, the results obtained will allow for an improved understanding of the redox behaviour of the highly active ARCs at the atomic level – a field of research that has been limited to theoretical studies so far","BRESSER Dominic",2021,1324314,"Karlsruhe Institute of Technology","excluded",NA
"ref_005","GLITR","Breaking through: The Impact of Turbulence on the Gas-Liquid Interface","A rigorous understanding of the role of turbulence, with its wide range of scales and phenomena, on mass transport across a gas-liquid interface (GLI) is one of the remaining challenges in fluid mechanics. Its importance is illustrated by considering that nearly 50% of anthropogenic CO2 is driven into the oceans by a turbulent process we do not fully understand. We know that turbulence modifies the topology of the GLI from both the liquid and gas sides, but due to the complexity of the problem, we do not understand the dominant mechanisms that control this process or how they connect to mass transfer. My previous work has both shown how turbulence can be tailored in the lab and how the parameters of the turbulence influence shear on a surface, making me well placed to tackle this problem. A plethora of models based on limited data exist for mass transfer across a GLI, but they have contrasting backgrounds, parameters, and results. This is indicative that something is missing and that there is a critical need for deeper understanding of the underlying phenomena. GLITR will provide a step change in our understanding of phenomena at the GLI by initiating a paradigm shift in the way lab experiments are conducted, considering the complexity of interacting turbulent gas and liquid flows for the first time. Tailored turbulence with adjustable intensity and length scales will be generated with an active turbulence generator in both the gas and liquid simultaneously to provide new insight not previously accessible. This will result in deformed interfaces that will necessitate the development of new methods to investigate the associated mass transport and fluid mechanics. Correlations between the tailored turbulence in both the gas and liquid, the surface topology, and the mass transport across the GLI will enable the development of data-driven models and breakthroughs in our understanding of interfacial phenomena while initiating a wholly new way of addressing this problem.","HEARST R.

"ref_006","SURFACE","Towards Future Interfaces With Tuneable Adhesion By Dynamic Excitation","Macroscopic adhesion is of utmost importance in key technologies such as soft and climbing robots, aerospace grasping technologies, human-robot interactions, pick-and-place manipulators. Commonly, bioinspired adhesives interfaces have been characterized from a quasi-static perspective, neglecting the effect of dynamic excitations. Nevertheless, recent observations suggest that added micro-vibrations may be exploited to strongly enhance and rapidly tune macroscopic adhesion. By exploiting the multiplicative coupling between geometric- and viscoelastic vibration-induced enhancements of macroscopic adhesion, SURFACE aims at designing future soft interfaces with unprecedented and tuneable adhesion strength. To this end, I aim to: (i) develop highly efficient numerical tools for studying adhesion of patterned soft surfaces under micro-vibration excitation, (ii) unveil the coupling effect between topography and viscoelasticity that determine the interfacial strength and toughness (iii) design optimal surface topography and excitation for macroscopic adhesion tuning, by exploiting artificial intelligence models to unveil new mechanisms for adhesion enhancement, (iv) prove the adhesive performance reached, by experimentally testing high-resolution 3D printed interfaces with the desired topography and superposed micro-vibrations. So far, the adhesive performance of bioinspired patterned interfaces has been limited by manufacturing capabilities at the micro/nanoscale. SURFACE ground-breaking approach aims at exploiting dynamics excitation to outperform state-of-the-art adhesive interfaces. By exploiting artificial intelligence models, SURFACE aims at revealing new mechanisms for adhesion enhancement, which lay beyond our intuition. Rapidly tuneable strong adhesive interfaces have the potential to revolutionize cutting-edge technologies based on soft adhesive interfaces that require to move and place objects quickly and with accuracy.","PAPANGELO Antonio",2021,1499750,"Polytechnic University of Bari","excluded",NA

Positive TPa as well as negative MPa pressures in liquids will be produced with limited resources available in everyday research environment. The project offers a unique integration of approaches and resources in high voltage engineering and plasma physics applications towards classical problems of compressible fluid mechanics. It investigates by experiment, computation and theory the major physical properties of imploding shock waves in liquids and offers approaches to enhance efficiency of the focal energy concentration. The project develops a novel method for generation of imploding rarefaction waves, a well controlled scenario that provides with exactly opposite range of extreme conditions, namely negative pressures in liquids. The approaches comprise a single generator facility that opens research on a broad spectrum of basic-to-applied subjects, promising a long-term investment towards studies of materials at extremes. The facility is applied on a selected subject of mechanical treatment of cellulose fibers, aiming at enhancing the efficiency of fibres disintegration, homogenization and fibrillation processes by applying, both selectively and combined, compression and tension pulses on a broad range of intensities, from strong to extreme.","LIVERTS Michael",2021,1496873,"Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)","excluded",NA
"ref_008","SCRAMBLE","Turbulence-On-a-Chip: Supercritically Overcoming the Energy Frontier in Microfluidics","The technological opportunities enabled by understanding and controlling the microscale world have not yet been capitalized to disruptively improve energy processes, especially heat transfer and power generation. This is mainly due to the laminar flows typically encountered in microdevices resulting in low mixing and transfer rates. This is a central unsolved problem in the thermal-fluid sciences, in what some researchers refer to as lab-on-a-chip and energy - the microfluidic frontier. Therefore, the overarching goal of the SCRAMBLE project is to overcome this long-standing frontier by (i) discovering the fundamentals of inducing turbulent flow in microchips by means of utilizing high-pressure supercritical fluids, (ii) finding the critical conditions to drastically enhance and control mixing and transfer processes, and (iii) designing, fabricating and testing a disruptive first-ever series of turbulence-on-a-chip prototypes for transferring energy with a hundredfold performance improvement with respect to standard microsystems. Achieving microconfined turbulence has deep scientific and engineering implications for disruptively advancing microfluidic-intensive applications, like for example in chemistry and biomedicine, and to open a new research avenue to develop and apply groundbreaking turbulent flow solutions to microfluidic energy conversion and power generation technologies (these consume an aggregated 70% of the European Union?s energy). In the medium- to long-term future, the technology proposed could enable (i) the efficient miniaturization of thermodynamic cycles for power generation, (ii) reconceptualization of the next-generation of computer processors based on remarkably powerful microfluidic-based cooling, and (iii) the adoption of novel microfluidic solutions in fuel cells for transportation and propulsion. These advances, together with many other potential breakthroughs, could help drive the transition toward a greener energy economy.","JOFRE CRUANYES Lluis",2021,1487500,"Technical University of Catalonia","excluded",NA
"ref_009","G-CYBERHEART","Computationally and experimentallY BioEngineeRing the next generation of Growing HEARTs","Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) results when the heart abnormally develops before birth. With diminished cardiac function, the heart fails to supply the required oxygenated blood to the body, causing a cascade of failures at different scales that prevent the newborn from growing normally. Even with improved surgical and medical treatments, CHD remains a lifelong risk factor for many diseases. An emerging application in cardiac tissue engineering is the 3D bioprinting of human hearts, or their parts, for clinical transplantation, with CHD representing a potential therapeutic target. Whereas the fabrication of bioartificial hearts is currently feasible, there remain significant scientific and technological challenges that yet need to be overcome. The development of novel experimental approaches is fundamental. At the same time, there is a pressing need for complementary computational methods to efficiently assist in the design of biophysically feasible and printable hearts, which must necessarily grow with the CHD patient's body while adapting to lifelong changes in hemodynamic conditions. In this project, therefore, I will develop a highly novel and interrelated experimental and computational approach for reproducing and predicting growing conditions of bioengineered hearts. The ambitious experimental design will enhance the maturation of cardiac muscle and biomechanical function of bioprinted ventricles in dynamic bioreactors. The highly-coupled multi-physics computational platform will describe these complex processes under multiple stimulated conditions to, ultimately, predict the critical adaptation and evolution of bioengineered ventricles potentially implanted in CHD patients. Therefore, by integrating ground-breaking methods within an extremely complex scenario, G-CYBERHEART will cross boundaries to drive advances in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering that will help accelerate the development of the bioengineered heart of the future.","LATORRE FERRÚS Marcos",2021,1497351,"Technical University of Valencia","excluded",NA
"ref_010","NoOne","A binary sensor with single-molecule digit to discriminate biofluids enclosing zero or at least one biomarker","Biomarkers are measurable indicators of a particular disease state of an organism. There has been an increasing demand for diagnostic markers, enabling reliable and non-invasive screening of peripheral biofluids. It is also established that a universal screening against life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, or infectious disease outbreaks, can be accomplished only by combining genomic and protein marker-based tests. The NoOne project aims at conceiving, engineering, fabricating and validating a ground-breaking platform based on a single-molecule binary bioelectronic sensor, capable to reliably discriminate biofluid samples enclosing zero biomarkers from those containing just one. The technology can be used for ultimate binary sensing of both proteins/peptides and genomic markers to enable the reliable screening of diseases such as cancer as well as viral and bacterial infections. The NoOne binary platform is designed to be portable, cost-effective, easy to operate and with a time-to-results within one hour. hence it is the ideal candidate for point-of-care applications. The prototype will enable clinicians, phytopathologists or veterinaries, to identify the set of samples that are totally free from a protein, peptide or genomic marker as well as from a pathogen (virus or bacteria), from those enclosing at least one with a confidence level of 99%. This makes the NoOne platform the best performing ever in enabling a fast, highly reliable, cost-effective identification of the subset of biological samples belonging to the potentially diseased part of a population. This is of paramount importance for predictive screening of humans, plants or animals. NoOne will demonstrate its effectiveness in key relevant applications such as the binary detection of pancreatic cancer biomarkers, SARS-CoV-2 virus, the Xylella Fastidiosa bacterium and the assay of post translational peptides evidencing the phosphorylated forms regulating crosstalk with oncogenic signalling pathways.","MACCHIA Eleonora",2021,2499579,"University of Bari Aldo Moro","excluded",NA
"ref_011","CILCat","Nanocarbon-Ionic Liquid-Interfaces for Catalytic Activation of Nitrogen","Ammonia is one of the most important chemicals in the world. Electrocatalytic reduction of nitrogen (NRR) at ambient conditions is a sustainable alternative for its production to the established energy consuming Haber-Bosch process, relying on hydrogen from fossil sources. The triple bond in dinitrogen is one of the most stable covalent chemical bonds. Conversely, the dissociation of dinitrogen and its chemical conversion is highly demanding. NRR is a carbon-neutral and decentral process that can be carried out wherever renewable electricity, water, and air are available. However, current research on NRR and other electrocatalytic reactions has reached an impasse as improvements based on catalyst design are getting more and more incremental. At this tipping point, CILCat tackles a foreseeable stagnation by constituting a disruptive principle that holds holistic perspectives for the activation of small molecules. The novel concept will go beyond established principles of isolated catalytically active sites. By confining ionic liquid (IL) electrolytes into charged porous carbon materials, an interface will be created, that as a whole serves as catalytic surface. CILCat will contribute to a fundamental understanding of the physicochemical principles of sorption into ILs upon confinement in pores. Targeted catalyst development will follow and the possibility of using the principle for catalytic activation of nitrogen and other molecules will be explored. This innovative approach will then be combined with advanced electrode design. CILCat aims for more than a step towards a future carbon-free nitrogen economy. It is a pioneering attempt to heterogenize homogenous catalysts by rather converting the energy principles of small molecule activation than chemical structures from solution to surfaces. The methodology is transferable to other obstacles in the field of catalysis and the project will lead to a more objective general understanding of reactivity in confined spaces.","OSCHATZ Martin",2021,1498590,"University of Jena","excluded",NA
"ref_012","REACHER","Reactive fluids for intensified thermal energy conversion","Thermal engines, refrigeration systems and heat pumps rely on thermodynamic cycles, in which an inert working fluid converts input thermal and mechanical energies into another useful energy form (work or heat) by cyclically transforming its thermal energy content. Although the selection of the working fluid is the main lever to increase their performances, whatever the fluid is, recorded efficiencies remain far below the highest achievable ones. This deficiency is strongly affecting the exploitation of waste heat and renewable thermal energies by closed power cycles, as well as representing the main cause of the slow performance improvement of heat pumps and cooling technologies. With the aim to effectively increase the performances of thermodynamic cycles, I propose to investigate a radically new thermodynamic structure, resulting from the use of equilibrated reactive working fluids instead of inert ones. Preliminary calculations have indeed shown that the simultaneous conversion of the thermal and chemical energy of reactive fluids may result in the intensification of these energy conversion processes. This project applies an original methodology that integrates thermodynamic and kinetic predictive tools to discover and characterize suitable reactive fluids, allowing for the quantification of the effects of reaction features on cycle performance and the optimization of the cycle?s configuration. The novelty of such a solution approach and comprehensiveness of the applied methodology builds the innovative character of REACHER. Probably due to the complex multi-disciplinarity of the problem or to the negligence of this possible way to convert chemical energy in thermodynamic cycles, this field has remained substantially unexplored. The successful development of REACHER will provide the former fundamental understanding on how chemical energy can be efficiently exploited in the intensification of thermodynamic cycles for power, refrigeration and heating purposes.","LASALA Silvia",2021,1436088,"University of Lorraine","excluded",NA
"ref_013","TRACE-it","Controlling particle flow driven by local concentration gradients in geological porous media","Many engineering applications foreseen the usage of small particles for groundwater remediation or for sealing damaged geological confinement barriers, however, delivering materials to a contaminated or damaged region is challenging. TRACE-it aims at controlling the flow of colloidal particles in subsurface geological environments using in situ solute concentration gradients. The phenomenon, known as diffusiophoresis, has a tremendous potential to move colloids to regions that are inaccessible by conventional transport. Diffusiophoretic transport in porous media, however, has received very little attention so far, especially in standard transport in porous media models where it remains unconsidered. What is the magnitude and location of solute concentration gradients produced during subsurface processes? How to use these gradients to transport colloids towards target regions? The answers will be found through a combined experimental-modelling approach to: (i) measure coupled hydro-electro-chemical dynamics, (ii) characterize concentration gradients generated in situ in geological porous media, (iii) identify the influence of concentration gradients on particle transport and develop a macroscale model of transport in porous media that includes diffusiophoresis. TRACE-it integrates the usage of microfluidic experiments, observation techniques, and multi-scale computational fluid dynamics to describe the transport mechanisms at the pore-scale before upscaling to the continuum-scale. The experimental-modelling toolset will open new ways for moving colloidal particles by sensing chemical gradients generated naturally or from human activity, leading them to their target such as oil, contaminants, or reacting minerals. During column-scale experiments, controlling colloid transport will be achieved through the characterization of solute concentration gradients and the use of specifically designed particles.","ROMAN Sophie",2021,1499985,"University of Orleans","excluded",NA

In-vitro pre-clinical models play a key role in fighting this burden by encompassing all the activities prior to clinical trials, from tumor microenvironment reconstruction to drug candidate selection. However, the frequent failure of promising pre-clinical drug candidates highlights two major drawbacks of these models: (i) the difficult reproduction of the dynamic cancer structure related to numerous physical cues. (ii) their experimental nature that suffers from high costs, long times, and limited understanding. Consequently, the relationship between dynamic physical cues, cell behavior, and drug efficacy is still unknown. CoDe4Bio tackles such a huge knowledge deficiency. We propose a radical methodology shift to a computational approach to harness programmable materials, able to change properties on demand, and realize dynamic 4D biofabricated models whose stimuli-triggered evolution over time (4th dimension) induces targeted physical cues on cancer cells. We will leverage my extensive experience with smart materials and structures to address the challenges of this multidisciplinary project. Specifically, we will develop a computational design framework for 4D biofabrication that combines new data-, geometry-, and model-based methods with additive manufacturing and in-vitro observations. This framework will allow us to develop customized stimuli-responsive materials and engineer a new generation of 4D constructs with programmable mechano-structural properties and acting as mechanical regulators. We will assess the constructs in-vitro on chronic lymphocytic leukemia to achieve a deep understanding on how complex physical cues within lymph nodes and bone marrow affect this incurable cancer in relation to chemoimmuno and targeted therapies.

"ref_015","MELTDYN","Understanding the melting dynamics in turbulent flows","Dissolving, eroding, and melting processes are ubiquitous in everyday life, nature, science, and technology. The challenge is to accurately predict the melting or dissolution rate e.g. of an iceberg or glacier---relevant for climate change---or of solid reactants in chemical reactors, important to accurately control reaction rates and temperatures. Current predictions for the melting of glaciers are often off by a factor of 100, and different melting models show inconsistencies. No general consensus of the cryospheric modeling has been reached yet. The difficulties in describing melting and dissolution stem from the multiscale nature of these processes (micrometers to kilometers) and the interaction between thermal, solutal, and viscous boundary layers and their complex interplay with the continuously reshaping boundary. A common belief is that melting always smooths the shape. However, from examples in nature and from theoretical analysis, it is clear that flows around melting or dissolving objects can create a rough (dimpled) surface, dramatically increasing the difficulty of accurate predictions. The objective of the project is to solve the gap in understanding and develop a quantitative understanding of the heat and mass transfer and the resulting melting and dissolution dynamics of fixed surfaces and freely-moving objects in turbulent flows from a fundamental fluid dynamics perspective. To do so, we will perform highly controlled lab experiments and numerical simulations, which allow for a combined experimental, numerical, and theoretical approach to reveal the underlying mechanisms of the melting and dissolution dynamics.

This will be done by coupling modular thermo- and photo-actuators to the traditional European fiber art of bobbin lace. The envisioned color-shape-communicative textile networks will include an on/off command of embedded functionalities by modifying an established concept – coiled yarn thermoactuators – to have different selective coatings on inner and outer surfaces of the coils. Furthermore, I will create unprecedented photoactuating coiled yarns, in which visible light turns on the functionality in a thread. The developed non-conformal coating techniques will also enable multifunctional threads, in which different parts of the thread can be commanded by different wavelengths of light. I will also develop two-dimensional multifunctional structures using these thermo- and photo-actuating threads as building blocks. The modularity of these building blocks, combined with the multiple thread system and three different braiding actions of bobbin lace, will enable a wide combinatorial parameter space for interactive network structures. I will demonstrate a textile that can, either upon illumination or thermal stimulus, change its color, its breathability/permeability, and activate a third function, such as colorimetric detection of a biomarker. These textiles could be used in clothes or window shades, e.g., adapting their warming/cooling capacity based on the external temperature or solar illumination. Such functional textiles would indirectly decrease the need for heating/cooling many buildings and allow energy savings, thus providing an important economic opportunity.

I aim to apply heterogeneous 3D printed MAPs as modifiable substrates to support biological structures which can have their deformation state and stiffness controlled by the external application of magnetic stimuli. Such mechanical stimulation has an important role on biological structures leading to alterations in functional responses, morphological changes and activation of growth or healing processes. Current bottlenecks preventing progress in this field are a lack of: a) appropriate experimental methodologies to enable characterisation of the behaviour of these materials. b) fundamental theoretical underpinnings to support the design and application of these new materials. The first step is to undertake in depth characterisation and assessment of 4D printed MAPs to create a detailed understanding of the underlying physics controlling the interactions between the polymeric matrices and embedded magnetic particles during application of mechanical and/or magnetic loadings. I will then culture biological structures on the novel 4D printed MAPs to create a ‘designed’ biostructure with specified and controllable responses to a given magnetic stimulus. These novel biostructures will be assessed using three applications: a) astrocyte cellular networks, b) neuronal circuits and c) astrocyte-neuronal networks. The evaluation of cellular damage, morphological and physiological alterations will validate the performance of the new biostructures and also contribute new understanding to the effects of deformation and stiffness gradients during glial scarring on physiological functions of central nervous system cells.

One of the main limits resides in the lesson we are able to learn today from experiments. We can successfully train actuators with probes in a controlled environment to reach a certain goal, e.g. aerodynamic drag minimization or noise reduction. on the other hand, an experimental technique that provides a full description of the flow is not available, thus generalization of the actuation effects to real applications is often prohibitive. The objective of NEXTFLOW is to conceive the next-generation flow-diagnostics aimed to flow control by leveraging the principles of completeness and compactness of the measurements. Completeness implies aiming to pursue a complete flow description, i.e. a time-resolved 3D characterization of velocity and thermodynamic variables. This will be achieved through a technique-integration approach based on data-driven methods. This grounds its basis on the principle that the superposed application of techniques is superior to their separate use. Compactness is pursued by exploring solutions with minimum technological complexity, and on developing new data output formats that are directly aimed at flow control applications. Key enablers for this task are (i) the novel concepts I recently proposed on data-driven techniques integration, (ii) the deep embedding of compressed-sensing methods in the data processing and (iii) the data-driven discovery of simplified governing equations of the dynamics. The next-generation flow diagnostics concept will deeply change experimental fluid mechanics and flow control, allowing bridging the gap between the laboratory experiment to the real application, with tremendous potential impact on numerous industrial applications.","DISCETTI Stefano",2020,1499062,"Carlos III University of Madrid","excluded",NA

Nevertheless, EPT development is currently stuck due to the incomplete understanding of their physics, in particular electromagnetic (EM) plasma heating and anomalous transport. Additionally, the cylindrical geometry of existing EPT designs has inherent issues, with high plasma losses and erosion at the rear wall of the ionization chamber and a wide divergence of the generated plasma jet. ZARATHUSTRA aims to unravel the physical underpinnings of EPTs and revolutionize their design by accomplishing three objectives: (1) establish the first self-consistent model of EM plasma heating in these devices. (2) elucidate the role of plasma turbulence, wall interactions, and applied EM fields on anomalous transport and devise control solutions to minimize plasma losses. and (3) assess the feasibility and advantages of a disruptive non-cylindrical EPT concept. This will be made possible thanks to a unique multidisciplinary methodology based on: a ground-breaking two-level numerical simulation strategy with a novel electromagnetic-kinetic algorithm. state-of-the-art experimental measurements. advanced data analysis techniques. and thruster bread-board prototype development.

This brittleness is intrinsically present in material composition that cannot plastically deform and make them sensitive to any defect introduced during their fabrication or usage. The goal of this project is to produce small Scale interlocking mechanism for Strong and Tough mEtamatEriaL (SSTEEL) that will provide a material independent solution to brittleness. Interlocking mechanisms provide in theory one of the most efficient way to increase toughness by creating crack blocking compressive stresses in response to tensile stresses. Because a brittle material strength is inversely linked to its size, my team and I first objective will be to develop a new process to form interlocking mechanism based on micron-sized elements using a combination of light-based additive manufacturing, shrinking ink design to access sub-printer resolution, and fragmentation. The second objective will be to implement this mechanism at an even smaller scale using rational material selection, solid state chemistry, and colloidal processing to fabricate an interfacial binder for the elements. The fracture process of SSTEEL sample will span several length scales and a specific task will be to use a combination of image correlation and modelling to fully characterise the existing damaging mechanism and inform the improvement of future designs.

For the first time, neurons will interact with the device by active mechanical reshaping which will transduce in the maintenance of the electrical network connection strength (long term potentiation –LTP). This will be achieved by a) processing dynamic electroactive materials b) engineering the neuromorphic abiotic surface with biological synaptic receptors and c) intergrate an in vitro biohybrid synapses array to investigate the interplay at the interface between neuronal cells and their synaptic activity with dynamic electrically-smart materials. BRAIN-ACT will pave the way for a new class of chip-based smart bioelectronic devices which will ‘have a shape of a neuron and act like a neuron’. Over 10 million people are affected by neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s worldwide and show significant loss of functionalities in their daily life. Those are mainly related to faulty connections within the brain which reflects neuronal miscommunication regulated by billions of individual connections among pairs called synapses. The ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken over time, in response to increases or decreases in their activity is called synaptic plasticity and is regulated through electrical and biomechanical signals exchanged by neurons pairs. In vitro bioelectronic platforms have been devoted to monitor and stimulate those signals across neuronal network areas to characterize electrical activity and connectivity in a passive manner.

This project aims at “Electrofluids” that conduct electrons while flowing as liquids. Because liquids have virtually no yield strength, they are ideal materials to replace solid metal leads in truly soft devices. ELECTROFLUID uses highly concentrated suspensions that are liquid in a wide temperature range. Transient conductive networks in suspended particles of commonly used conductors provide high level of electronic conductivity at the viscosities required for soft electronics and robots. They contain common conductive materials such as carbon, silver, gold, and copper and do not require specialized low-melting alloys of gallium or other expensive elements. In order to create stable Electrofluids with large conductivity at low viscosity with tuneable rheology, I study the interplay between particle-particle friction, contact resistance, percolation, bulk resistance, and suspension viscosity. I use both custom-synthesized and commercial particles in a size range of tens of nanometres to few microns and with different shapes, modify their surfaces with conventional and pi-conjugated surfactants, and formulate concentrated suspensions that exhibit large conductivity at low viscosity. The combination of different particle sizes, shapes, and fluids enables tuning the properties of the fluid towards specific application cases, for example to create highly flexible leads for logic signals versus high-power connections for the connection of actuators. The fluids will be encapsulated in elastomer tubes or micropatterned surfaces as they are commonly used in stretchable electronics. The specific aims of the project are: (i) to design highly concentrated suspensions that form transient percolating networks, (ii) to use this knowledge and synthesize fluids with tuneable electrical conductivity at low viscosity, (iii) to demonstrate that Electrofluids can be curtailed for particular applications.","González-García Lola",2020,1499375,"Leibniz Institute for New Materials","excluded",NA

Material evolutions within the sub-surface region affected by oxidation (0.1 to 100 µm deep gradient) generally drive premature damage and the unexpected ruin of bulky structural components. Therefore, assessing the evolutions of the local deformation at the sub-grain scale at high temperature using micro- and mesomechanical approaches is the key point to clarify thermo-mechano-chemical interactions favouring early damage. HT-S4DefOx aims to tackle such small-scale and pluridisciplinary investigations on Ni-based and Ti-based model materials. Advanced high temperature micromechanical techniques (high resolution-digital image correlation (HR-DIC), in-situ TEM mechanical testing, in-situ micropillar/nanoindentation testing, synchrotron nano-tomography and topotomography) will be purposely coupled with numerical simulations (phase field-coupled crystal plasticity finite element methods). My unique expertise in mesoscale ultrathin specimen preparation and testing allows the present experimental investigation of the coupling between surface reactivity and local deformations. The development of novel mesoscale flexural techniques with real-time 3D observation of the specimen deformation up to 1000°C will finally bridge the gap between micro- and macroscale mechanical characterisations, with an emphasis on graded properties materials. Investigating sub-surface behaviour during oxidation lies in the inability to achieve robust measurement at such hidden location. In addition, the surface texture evolution while oxide growth constitutes another significant obstacle. Therefore, smart surface monitoring for high temperature HR-DIC at the microscale and inverse numerical methods will give unique and quantitative information on the local mechanical behaviour of such “invisible” materials.","TEXIER Damien Romain",2020,2493277,"National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS)","excluded",NA

In industrial plants, excessive electrostatic charges can even lead to hazardous sparks, which have caused numerous catastrophic dust explosions in the past. However, despite its long history of investigation, it is not currently possible to predict the buildup, transport, and accumulation of charge. Starting from 2015, I developed a numerical approach with the important capability to couple the involved scientific disciplines – fluid mechanics (turbulent carrier flow), surface science (triboelectric particle charging), and electrostatics (forces between charges). The first ever fully-resolved simulations revealed that the occurrence of distinct physical flow mechanisms determines the charging rate of powder. This knowledge opens a new way to control the electrification through triggering these mechanisms and, thus, to solve the problem finally. To this end, this proposal aims to develop a novel interdisciplinary computational tool. This task includes establishing several new numerical concepts, such as a single-particle charging model. Beyond the state-of-the-art single-particle and powder flow electrification experiments which both employ innovative measurement methodologies will support the theoretical efforts. The proposed test set-ups will bring about a paradigm shift by quantifying, for the first time, reproducible, facility independent data, tailored specifically to complement the model formulation. The successful project will provide an open-source tool that enables the prediction, evaluation, and limitation of electrostatic charges. To this respect, the research aims not only to prevent accidents in industrial facilities but also to understand the physics of other kinds of electrifying powder flows and to solve a long-standing scientific riddle.","Grosshans Holger",2020,1471225,"National Metrology Institute of Germany (PTB)","excluded",NA

State-of-the-art developments push these soft robotic systems towards applications such as rehabilitation and diagnostic devices, exoskeletons for gait assistance, and grippers that can handle delicate objects. However, despite these exciting developments, there are two major challenges: (1) existing electronic control, intelligence and power of soft robots is too bulky to be embedded, and (2) the power efficiency of soft robots is extremely low. As a result, most existing soft robots still rely on tethers to deliver the required power and control. To increase the application perspective of soft robots, I aim to ‘cut the tethers’, with the ultimate goal to realise fully autonomous and smart soft robots that can interact with humans and complex environments. To do so, I propose to replace electronics with embedded fluidic circuits in a three step approach. First, I aim to achieve intelligent behaviour in soft robots by embedding smart fluidic circuits, that have integrated fluidic sensors to allow for feedback with the environment. Then, I will close the fluidic circuit to be able to reuse elastic energy that is currently lost after each actuation cycle, to dramatically increase the efficiency of soft robots. Finally, I will embed a reliable pressure source based on chemical fuel regulated by soft fluidic circuits. Taken together, I propose to develop new concepts to effectively power and control the behaviour of soft robots, and to achieve this I will develop new experimental standards, computational approaches, and generalise design principles. As a results, this research will pave the way for the first fully autonomous soft robots that are capable of operating for longer periods of time.","OVERVELDE Johannes T.

Fuel cells, electrolysers and flow batteries are used for conversion to and from fuel and have advantages over batteries as storage capacity is cell size independent. Reactant and product transport set the maximum current density obtainable determined by the interplay between multiphase and opposing vapor and liquid flow. To understand this limit, a better way of controlling transport of reactant and products within electrodes is necessary. In particular, we need to (1) tune convection for distributing reactant concentration, (2) tailor the interplay between Knudsen and bulk diffusion, (3) tailor capillary forces to remove liquid products and (4) ensure fast reaction kinetics through reducing the reaction energy barrier. Electrode design is hence key, yet current architectures provide limited control over feature sizes, length scales and geometrical complexity, making the study of transport mechanisms tedious and controlled experiments difficult. We propose a radically new way of studying mass transport in electrodes via the direct conversion of multiscale computer designs into physical glassy carbon electrodes with desired surface functionality. We propose to (i) develop a photopolymer based AM process for tailored glassy carbon architectures with features ranging over multiple length scales, (ii) study the interplay between convective flow and diffusion throughout the electrode architecture, (ii) geometrically separate reactant and product transport, (iii) study and improve liquid product management and (iv) create catalytically active nitrogen doped carbon architectures potentially omitting the need for noble metal catalysts.

However, the main roadblock preventing its widespread adoption is the inability to design microstructures with desired mechanical responses. An AM process results in the formation of hierarchical microstructures that are extremely sensitive to the process parameters. Minor changes to these parameters can result in very different microstructures that exhibit significant differences in their mechanical response at multiple length scales. Controlling the mechanical response of hierarchical microstructures requires first understanding their formation during the AM process. Current experimental and modeling research efforts are heavily focused on studying the role of melt-pool dynamics and rapid solidification during the AM process. This project aims at tackling the crucial missing link, which is the microstructure evolution occurring during the long period after solidification and till the end of an AM process, i.e. during Solid-State Thermal Cycling (SSTC), at varying temperature rates and amplitudes. Using novel experimental procedures involving electron microscopy and x-ray synchrotron studies, I will quantify microstructural changes and identify micro-mechanisms caused by SSTC. This will be complemented with development of novel models at intragranular and polycrystalline levels to gain a comprehensive understanding of the role of transient thermal gradients on microstructure evolution. The experiment-modeling synergy will then be harnessed to tailor AM process parameters and suggest in-process/post-process routes to engineer AM microstructures.

Nowadays, conventional approaches to nanofabrication reached the fundamental physical limits for the downscaling of devices, so that the search for groundbreaking new paradigms has become vital for enabling significant technological advancement. This project aims to go substantially beyond conventional nanofabrication approaches, through the following ambitious research objectives: 1) Demonstrate a radically new approach to nanofabrication, phase-nanoengineering, based on directly crafting at the nanoscale the physical properties of thin-film materials, by using the recently developed thermally assisted scanning probe lithography (t-SPL) technique for producing highly localized and tunable thermally-induced phase changes. 2) Develop a new class of artificial nanomaterials with unprecedented electronic transport properties, which arise from the proximity and coexistence of different structural and electronic phases, tailored at the nanoscale. 3) Realize novel monolithic three-dimensional nanoelectronic platforms for beyond-CMOS computing, by exploiting the unique capabilities of t-SPL for obtaining sub-10 nm resolution patterning in three-dimensions.

This phenomenon was deeply investigated in the last decades in order to harvest the so-called salinity gradient power. One of the most incipient technology that allows to harvest this energy is the Capacitive Mixing (CapMix) and its working mechanism is based on a fluidic electrochemical cell, similar to a supercapacitor. Since this mixing phenomenon holds true for both liquids and gases, my idea is to harvest energy from anthropic CO2. The energy density stored in the CO2 emission is tremendously higher than that stored in salinity gradient and theoretically estimated as high as 1570 TWh/year. Since ions are needed in CapMix process, with CO2CAP I propose for the first time to exploit a green ionic liquid (IL), i.e. a bio-derived molten salt at room temperature, both as electrolyte and CO2 absorbing medium in a CapMix cell. The principle consists of flowing a concentrated CO2 gas stream, alternated to vacuum step, in the IL during the charging/discharging of two electrodes. The CO2 will induce an electric double layer (EDL) expansion of charges at the electrode/IL interface thereby converting the released mixing energy into electrical energy. To reach this goal, the objectives of CO2CAP are to develop novel cutting-edge carbon-based electrodes and amino acid-based IL designed to maximize the EDL of charges at the electrode/IL interface, enhancing at the same time the CO2 absorption capacity. This will be possible by using a multidisciplinary approach based on materials engineering, modelling, advanced characterization methods and novel architecture of the electrodes. The engineered materials and cell will allow to demonstrate the feasibility of this new electrochemical approach, enabling a deeper understanding of the physical and electrochemical phenomena occurring in such a complicated system, and paving the way to a new generation of CO2-free renewable energy source.","Lamberti Andrea",2020,1497500,"Polytechnic University of Turin","excluded",NA

By developing nanoindentation into a new tool for high strain rate testing, we will achieve a groundbreaking improvement of the spatial resolution of high strain rate mechanical testing by 10^6. This extraordinary improvement will be possible through simultaneous advances in hardware and experimental methods. This new nanoscale approach will enable a breakthrough in the fundamental understanding of the mechanical behavior of materials at high strain rates down to their constituent microstructural elements. We will isolate single grain boundaries and measure their individual contribution to strength and embrittlement as a function of strain rate, crystal structure and grain boundary energy. The local resistance to dislocation transmission, migration and fracture will be correlated to the overall Hall-Petch strengthening behavior of the polycrystal. The payoff will be a better understanding and predictability of embrittlement events at high strain rates. A second breakthrough will be made possible in understanding the interplay between plasticity and brittle fracture at high strain rates in some of the technologically most important hard coatings, including toughened glass used in mobile phone screens and TiAlN based coatings, commonly used in tooling.

These materials need to fulfil two major requirements namely processability into complex and customized shapes and local interactions with selected electromagnetic waves. The aim of this research is to develop polymeric multi-phasic electromagnetic metamaterials generated by a novel processing method, i.e. flow-induced structure printing. The novel method, featuring a complex static mixer in the nozzle of the printer, will make it possible to create 3-dimensional materials having substructures that are up to 100 times smaller than the dimension of the printer nozzle. By using polymeric materials with conductive and magnetic inclusions, 3D structures will be generated that allow to induce electromagnetic metamaterial responses such as wave bending or complete absorption. To enable these groundbreaking developments in material design and processing, fundamental understanding should be generated on the relations between microstructure and electromagnetic properties in 3D structured materials with conductive and magnetic inclusions combined with their flow-induced structure development. My extensive background in rheology, fluid mechanics, material design and equipment development will allow to tackle the diverse challenges in realizing these unique materials and processing method. The general design strategies and processing method will also enable to generate hierarchical materials for other high-end applications such as interdigitated batteries and solar cells.","CARDINAELS Ruth",2020,1499875,"University of Leuven","excluded",NA

Further progress in these areas, however, is often hindered by the limitations of current rechargeable lithium ion battery technologies, which are among the most common power sources for these systems. Despite tremendous progress in electrode materials, the intrinsic drawbacks of current batteries are related to their planar two-dimensional design, which restrains the performance in terms of output power and charging speed. NANO-3D-LION is aimed to make a breakthrough in these major battery characteristics by a paradigm shift in battery engineering: the goal is to develop and employ advanced nanoscale 3D printing techniques to fabricate active battery materials with ultrasmall structural features, which will provide almost a thousand-fold increase in the surface area of the battery enabled by nanoscale spacing between its electrodes without compromising the battery capacity. To reach this, high-aspect ratio metal features will be fabricated and further converted into the active material of the cathode and the anode. This will enable unprecedented level of control of the battery architecture, allowing groundbreaking improvement of the key battery performance characteristics, including higher output power and charging times of only several seconds. NANO-3D-LION will establish a unique engineering approach with a potential to completely change the future landscape in research and industry related to portable electronic devices and electric vehicles and will also benefit many technologies beyond battery research, where nanoscale 3D printing opens new unparalleled capacity, therefore ensuring its broad scientific, economical and societal impact.","MOMOTENKO Dmitry",2020,2255055,"University of Oldenburg Carl von Ossietzky","selected",NA

These applications include mirco- and nano-technologies along with plasma-based coating processes of nano device fabrication itself, where small dimensions lead to non-eq. effects. But the applications range right up to other key areas, e.g. re-entry flows and flows around satellites, where rarefied gas and high velocities cause non-equilibrium. Furthermore, continuing miniaturization and increase of process energies will lead to non-eq. effects within technologies in the near future e.g. micro- and nano-fabrication, next-generation lithography or various space systems such as electric propulsion or actively electrodynamically shielded re-entry. At the moment, non-eq. is still a perturbing phenomenon, because experimental measurements are complicated and simulation tools are only available for specialised problems due to the complexity. The objective is to progress toward particle-based multiscale methods for thermo-chemical non-eq. gas and plasma flows allowing for the first time simulations of the whole range of high-tech applications and maintaining the competitiveness of European future industry. As the availability of computational resources increases with decreasing prices, particle methods have become a novel attractive, accurate and elegant numerical tool. This project will connect competences in physics, mathematics, chemistry and computational science and extend the open-source code platform PICLas, resulting in a direct benefit for the simulation community. Finally, as a main contributor in the field of particle-based fluid dynamics and the main developer of PICLas, I am confident to establish these novel methods as the state-of-the-art in research and academia as well as to enable their utilization in industrial applications.","Pfeiffer Marcel",2020,1446125,"University of Stuttgart","excluded",NA

The intermittent nature of the latter means innovations in energy storage technology is a key grand challenge. Cost and sustainability issues currently limit the widespread use of electrochemical energy storage technologies, such as lithium ion and redox flow batteries. As the scale for energy storage is simply enormous, the only option is to look for abundant materials. However, compounds that fulfil the extensive requirements entailed at low cost has yet to be reported. While it is possible that the holy grail of energy storage will be found, for example by advanced computational tools and machine learning to design “perfect” abundant molecules, a more flexible, innovative solution to sustainable and cost-effective large-scale energy storage is required. Bi3BoostFlowBat will develop game changing strategies to widen the choice of compounds utilizable for batteries to simultaneously satisfy the requirements for low cost, optimal redox potentials, high solubility and stability in all conditions. The aim of this project is to develop cost-efficient batteries by using solid boosters and by eliminating cross over. Two approaches will be pursued for cross-over elimination 1) bio-inspired polymer batteries, where cross-over of solubilized polymers is prevented by size-exclusion membranes and 2) biphasic emulsion flow batteries, where redox species are transferred to oil phase droplets upon charge. Third research direction focuses on systems to maintain a pH gradient, to allow operation of differential pH systems to improve the cell voltages. Limits of different approaches will be explored by taking an electrochemical engineering approach to model the performance of different systems and by validating the models experimentally.

Such collisions are fundamental to the flotation process, a technology widely used in industry. Applications include wastewater treatment, paper recycling, and especially mining, where flotation is used to separate minerals. This process commonly operates under strongly turbulent conditions and the important role of turbulence is now a widely accepted fact in the mineral engineering community. The actual effect of turbulence on the bubble-particle collision rate, however, remains unclear. This is largely because effects arising from a finite drift velocity of suspended species, such as preferential concentration, remain entirely unexplored and hence unaccounted for. Bubbles and light particles behave fundamentally different in a turbulent flow compared to their heavy counterparts and therefore the problem. Therefore the bubble-particle problem is fundamentally different from e.g. droplet collisions in clouds, requiring new concepts. I intend to investigate bubble-particle collisions through combined experimental and numerical efforts. Experiments using Particle Tracking Velocimetry will provide much needed reference data while direct numerical simulations via point-particle and immersed-boundary methods will allow us to study various physical effects in detail. Together, these will enable us to develop and test realistic theories and models for the geometric collision rate between particles and bubbles as well as for their collision efficiency. The ultimate goal is a physics-based parametrization of the effective bubble-particle collision rate in realistic conditions.","Krug Dominik Johannes",2020,1500000,"University of Twente","excluded",NA

Wastewater treatment sludge and manure treatment technologies are currently not satisfactory and there is no solution to efficiently re-use the resources it contains: phosphorous and carbon. The aim of REBOOT is to completely recover phosphorous from wastes while generating carbon neutral transportation fuels and a carbon sink in the form of carbon materials. The project will employ a frontier technology called hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) which uses high temperature and pressure to produce a liquid product similar to petroleum termed bio-crude. This will be used for a range of innovative applications such as renewable aviation fuel, functionalized carbon materials and bio-bitumen. The possibility of complete phosphorous recovery in HTL is a completely new concept, previously thought impossible as only continuous HTL reactors can theoretically achieve this. The complex hydrothermal chemistry of salts can only be exploited on such advanced reactors that are currently beyond state-of-the-art. The specific objectives of REBOOT are: (1) mechanistic understanding of salt behaviour in multi-phase hydrothermal systems with the aim of full recovery. (2) Develop tailored strategies for in-situ jet fuel synthesis. (3) Establish microbial electrolysis cells for in-situ hydrogen production and nutrient recovery. REBOOT will be carried out on pilot continuous reactors, where the challenging physical conditions can be explored, exploited and new engineering solutions developed. If REBOOT is successful it will enable society to tackle existing waste problems while recovering nutrients and producing renewable materials, replacing fossil derived ones. representing a revolutionary solution to wet waste management in the emerging circular bio-economy.","BILLER Patrick",2019,1494622,"Aarhus University","excluded",NA

Electrochemical methods have the advantage of single-step, energy-efficient and low-temperature conversion of chemicals. However, despite developments in electrocatalysts and system design in the past decade, none of the electrochemical methods has grown to a market-leading technology in the energy or water sector because of limitations in process intensification. A boost in electrical current density, without sacrificing energy efficiency, is required to allow large-scale deployment. This process intensification needs breaking three limitations in mass transport, at three different scales: 1) the diffusion boundary layer (microscale), 2) gas bubble interference (mm-scale) and 3) concentration gradients in the flow compartments bulk. This ERC project will use a multiscale approach to address these three mass transport limitations, and has the objective to understand and enhance mass transport using novel concepts. Diffusion limitations will be addressed via studying suspension electrodes, gas bubbles will be controlled while synergistically disturbing the diffusion boundary layer via pressure swing control, and reactor engineering concepts that are new to the field of electrochemistry are used to mitigate macro-scale concentration gradients. Water electrolysis, CO2 electrolysis and electrodialysis will be used as tool to evaluate these strategies, using fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) and micro particle image velocimetry (μPIV) to observe the local environment at microscale within large-scale systems.

Less appreciated but equally important, the extracellular matrix (ECM) around the cells also adapts to accommodate cell activity. This highly dynamic feedback between the cell and the ECM has been increasingly recognized to play a key role in not only tissue morphogenesis and functions, but also a variety of diseases, from cardiomyopathies to cancer. Moreover, it presents an unprecedented challenge in healthcare and therapeutics, especially regenerative medicine, as progress in this field requires a paradigm shift from conventional, static cell descriptions to a co-evolving cell and tissue physiology. This proposal aims to instigate this transformation by unravelling the fundamental biophysical principles behind cell–matrix dynamic reciprocity and generating a multiscale roadmap of mechanoadaptation critical in functional tissue regeneration. To achieve this goal, we will develop cutting-edge in vitro manipulation tools to deconstruct and rebuild the dynamics of cells and the ECM independently and interactively, thereby granting us full spatiotemporal control of each component in the system. Using this unique tissue-environment-inspired bottom-up approach, we will dissect how 1) physical changes in the environment are sensed and elicit response by the cell, 2) cell-induced ECM remodeling contributes to mechanical signal transmission, and 3) these local changes are orchestrated into global coordinated mechanoadaptation at the tissue level. The findings will have a broad impact on our fundamental understanding of cell and tissue physiology by identifying novel concepts in mechanoadaptation and will offer specific biomaterial design principles for tissue regeneration.

Membrane separators play a crucial role in flow batteries by selectively transporting ions while preventing the crossover of redox-active materials.

Hence, researchers need to identify efficient routes towards solar fuels production. Unlike H2 evolution, CO2 photoreduction has been poorly studied. Given the scope for CO2 utilisation in a carbon-constrained future, there is an exciting opportunity to devote targeted research towards CO2 photoreduction. Photocatalysis is one route towards CO2 reduction. Yet, the design of a cost-effective, sustainable, efficient and robust photocatalyst remains a highly challenging task. PROPOSAL: I propose to merge catalysis, materials science and engineering to develop a radically new class of photocatalysts, i.e. porous boron nitride (BN)-based materials for CO2 reduction. My approach is opposite to current research trends which explore non-crystalline and non-porous materials, and aims to compete with the 40-year old benchmark in the field, TiO2. Porous BN combines key attributes for CO2 photoreduction: (i) chemical, structural and optoelectronic tunability, (ii) high porosity, (iii) semi-crystalline to amorphous nature. These features provide unique pathways towards effective sorption of reactants/products, facile band gap engineering, and enhanced surface charge transfer. Their semi-crystalline to amorphous nature may facilitate scale-up. IMPACT: I will address three major challenges: 1. Creating a porous BN-based material platform with adsorptive and photocatalytic functionalities 2. Adding a new dimension to photocatalyst design via porosity control 3. Creating approaches to molecular- and micro-structure engineering in porous BN Realization of these advances would lead towards a ‘dream photocatalyst’ with integrated adsorptive, optoelectronic and catalytic functionalities.

Within the family of nanomaterials, colloidal semiconductor nanocrystal (NCs) are among the most investigated, thanks to their desirable optoelectronic properties. Up until now, NCs have been employed in light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and lasers of relatively large size (devices of at least few hundred microns in area), therefore exploiting the properties of the ensemble (i.e., a NC film). LEDs based on ensemble of NCs show good performance in terms of efficiency and luminance but their applicability is still limited to standard consumer electronics products such as displays and illumination. Interestingly, thanks to quantum confinement a single isolated NC displays single photon emission, a desirable property for application in quantum technologies. Such property has been studied in detail using optical excitation. Yet, the challenge is to exploit single photon emission from a NC under electrical excitation but this requires the development of complex fabrication tools and methods for device preparation. NANOLED aims at developing light-emitting diodes based on individual colloidal NCs, thus paving the way to novel electrically driven single-photon sources with small footprint that are embeddable in photonic quantum networks. Further development of quantum technologies requires the investigation of devices based on novel materials for single photon generation.

This proposal aims at establishing a radically new approach for polymer material design, rethinking AM on both material and process level. Here, functionality will be already embedded at the building block level to emerge into larger scales. The exact methodology relies on polymer microparticles as a novel material basis with arbitrary geometry, function, mechanics and responsiveness. These microparticulate formulations will serve as predefined, voxel-like building blocks in AM yielding hierarchical assemblies with spatially defined voxel position and programmable, adaptive properties, which clearly go beyond existing functional material classes. With that, 3DPartForm will address the current lack of additive manufacturing providing multifunctional, stimuli-responsive materials, in which not only strongly different, but most importantly functional building blocks with intrinsic time axis will be processed into true 4D-polymer multimaterials. Products emerging from this approach will reach a previously unknown level of system integration, where optical transparency, electric and thermal conductivity as well as diffusivity and mechanical rigidity will become spatiotemporally tunable at single-voxel level. Coupled sensing and actuation operations will be realized by processing, transforming and manipulating single or combined input stimuli within these materials in the focus of 3DPartform, and platforms for biomimetics and cell-free biotechnology will be implemented as a long-term goal.","Thiele Julian",2019,1474125,"Leibniz Institute of Polymer Research Dresden (IPF)","selected",NA

Development of application designs and approaches for modelling these complex processes have led to better optimized systems. Plasma-discharge formation is randomized and transient and these plasma-induced processes occur in volatile and harsh environments. Conventional methods for investigating plasma phenomena mainly rely on electric probe techniques, ex-situ mass spectroscopy or passive light emission analysis.

Promotion of alternative energy sources such as geothermal energy intensifies cyclic perturbations of the underground environment. Both lead to precipitation-dissolution cycles of salts, natural constituents of brines present inside porous rock. When precipitation occurs inside the pores, stresses build up which eventually crack the material. This might be a positive outcome, e.g., increasing the production rate of a geothermal reservoir, or on the contrary, be the cause of severe deterioration of natural building stones and coastal erosion. What is the actual trigger for the dynamic response of a rock when precipitation occurs, and can we ultimately control this trigger? The answer lies at the meso-scale, i.e. the scale of the pore network, where precipitation-dissolution reactions, geometry changes and flow and transport properties changes meet. These reactions and changes are strongly coupled, but their respective importance for the resulting rock dynamics is unclear. A combined experimental-modelling approach will be developed, comprising: (1) 4D X-ray micro-tomographic experiments providing new insights in the correlations between transport-precipitation-deformation processes inside rock.

However, these materials operate at high magnetic fields, thus, limiting potential application of the technology. A promising approach to significantly enhance the magnetomechanical performance, and reduce the required magnetic field, is to design soft magnetoactive composites through architectured microstructures. Highly ordered microstructures are an origin for multiscale magnetomechanical instabilities and possible failure of the materials.

In theory, the designer can conceive VAT structures with unexplored capabilities and tailor materials with optimized stiffness-to-weight ratios. In practise, steering brittle fibres, generally made of glass or carbon, is not trivial. Printing must be performed at the right combination of temperature, velocity, curvature radii and pressure to preserve the integrity of fibres. The lack of information on how the effect of these parameters propagates through the scales, from fibres to the final structure, represents the missing piece in the puzzle of VAT composites, which today are either costly or difficult to design because affected by unpredictable failure mechanisms and unwanted defects (gaps, overlaps, and fibre kinking).

Compared to the state-of-the-art compound semiconductors and organic light emitting diodes (OLED), the CQD-based LEDs possess extremely high color purity and low materials cost, representing the only feasible materials solution towards realization of the newly-defined Rec. 2020 standard for the next-generation displays. However, the theoretical upper limit of the device external quantum efficiency (EQE) is only ~20%, considerably lower than those in OLEDs and InGaN LEDs. The fundamental bottleneck is that it is not yet possible to control the emission directionality perpendicular to the substrate plane in the CQD superlattices, without compromising the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). As a result, a lot of photons are wasted due to the total internal reflection (TIR) at the air/glass interface, as well as exciton quenching during interparticle energy transfer. In order to overcome the efficiency limitation, my research group pioneers synthesis, physics, and LED device of layer-controlled colloidal quantum wells (CQWs) of organic-inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskites (OIHPs), the two-dimensional nanocrystals of OIHP in colloidal solution. Our results have suggested that the materials system might be the ultimate solution for the quantum-dot based LEDs. We found that the CQWs possess: (i) the aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics, boosting the film PLQY up to 97%, and (ii) the emission directionality (ED) perpendicular to the substrate plane in their self-assembled superlattices. Based on the new photophysical properties that have never been found in any other CQD systems, in this proposal, we aim to optimally utilize the characteristics of the AIE and ED, in order to realize high-efficiency and long-lifetime LED technology that can fulfill 100% Rec. 2020 color gamut.","SHIH Chih-Jen",2019,1498515,"Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich)","excluded",NA

Despite significant efforts, rationally designed materials that are intrinsically resistant to crystallization fouling without the use of active methods like antiscalant additives (which can persist long after their disposal and the toxicological impact of which in effluent is questioned) remain elusive. This is because antiscalant surfaces are constructed today without sufficient reliance on an intricate but necessary science-base, of how interweaved interfacial thermofluidics, nucleation thermodynamics, and surface nanoengineering control the onset of nucleation and adhesion of frequently encountered scaling salts like calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate. Such scaling salts are common components of fouling deposits in industrial heat exchangers and membranes, which significantly inhibit heat transfer and flow performance. Therefore, guided by interfacial thermofluidic and thermodynamics theories, and employing advanced experimental methods in the areas of surface nanoengineering and diagnostics, this project will develop an integrated knowledge-base for how engineered surfaces can beneficially interact with interfacial transport phenomena in order to significantly advance antiscalant surfaces. We aim to pinpoint mechanisms for inhibiting scale nucleation and reducing adhesion in order to design and engineer antiscalant materials based on the collaborative action of their composition and topography. The effects of surface texture curvature, surface composition, and substrate compliance on scale nucleation and adhesion have intertwined and sometimes competing impacts, which we aim at elucidating to realize high performance scale-phobic surfaces. Connected to this are cutting edge materials fabrication techniques and considerations to the development of surfaces for future applications.","Schutzius Thomas",2019,1963625,"Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich)","excluded",NA

PCM is faster and more durable than state-of-the-art non-volatile memory devices like silicon-based solid-state drives (SSD), and it can furthermore be scaled in all three dimensions.

In the EU alone, estimates are in the range of 250 billion € annually, with an expected steep increase over the coming decades. This urgently calls for new, cost-effective corrosion mitigation strategies to prolong the useful life of ageing civil infrastructures. Electrochemical corrosion protection (ECP) methods have a large potential to play a key role in addressing this challenge. However, to match these expectations, game-changing advances are needed in both science and engineering. Limited routine use and poor engineering practice of ECP can be traced to insufficient theoretical grounds and a lack of fundamental quantification of key processes. The aim of this proposal is to develop the scientific basis to deliver the first scientifically anchored engineering model and to unlock the potential of ECP as an innovative solution to the grand challenge of rapidly deteriorating infrastructures. The focus areas include: 1) for the first time integrating all relevant physical, chemical, and electrochemical processes into a quantitative model framework for the systematic study of fundamental processes and evaluation of solution strategies. An important novelty lies in combining reactive transport modeling in porous media with rigorous corrosion science. 2) Elucidating the poorly understood role of microbiology in corrosion. and 3) Devising new experiments that link corrosion science and electrochemistry with environmental science methods. Only by delivering ground-breaking scientific contributions will it be possible to abandon empiricism in the field and pave the way towards a new, scientifically sound generation of ECP technology to ensure safety, cost-efficiency, and sustainability of our infrastructures.","ANGST Ueli",2019,1497815,"Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich)","excluded",NA

The amount of electricity annually wasted due to the losses in such systems in the EU corresponds to at least billions of euros. A major part of these losses arises in passive magnetic components, such as inductors and transformers, which are also the largest and heaviest components of a power electronic device. The physical phenomena related to the power losses in the magnetic cores of these components are not properly understood at the moment. In addition, the engineering community is currently lacking efficient modeling tools for analyzing the losses in the windings of such components at high frequencies. Improvement of high-frequency magnetic components would require accurate understanding of the power loss mechanisms. However, the device-level losses are affected by physical effects taking place in the microscopic grain and domain structures and very thin conductors, which are often subject to geometrical uncertainties. Accurate geometrical models cannot be used for analyzing the devices due to the impossibly large computational burden. In MULTIMAG, we will address these challenges by establishing a set of new multiscale numerical modeling tools, which will provide insight into the origin of the power losses and make it possible to perform statistical analysis of the electromagnetic behaviour of such components. The application potential of these new numerical tools will be demonstrated by designing working prototypes of emerging power electronic devices, such as a solid-state transformer and a wireless power transfer system. We will also develop inverse problem approaches for identifying the models from available catalog data, lowering the threshold for adopting the models into use.

The question is: How do we find those central high-performers combining high strength and the essential deformability giving safety in application? It is the aim of FUNBLOCKS to provide the first systematic studies of plasticity mechanisms in the most fundamental building blocks of complex crystals. These will allow us to deduce the missing basic mechanisms and signatures of plasticity. FUNBLOCKS will take a new approach by studying the much simpler sub-units that form the multitude of more complex crystals with large unit cells amongst the intermetallics. This has three major implications: i) the reduction to fundamental units allows suffi-cient time to unravel the major deformation mechanisms to the atomic level, ii) the recurrent nature of the few fundamental building blocks will allow a transfer of this knowledge to a large number of complex phases and iii) together, this will enable data mining from the vast and largely unexplored phase space of intermetallics. The key aspect of FUNBLOCKS is therefore to close the existing gap in knowledge and allow us to find promising new phases by elucidating the fundamental relationships between crystal structure and plasticity beyond what we know in simple metals. To identify and quantify the intrinsic mechanical properties of each sub-unit, state-of-the-art micromechanical testing techniques will be used. Transfer of data and verification of the central hypothesis, that fundamental units govern plasticity in complex crystals, will be achieved via additional alloyed crystals forming ternary variants of the binary structures. Ultimately, FUNBLOCKS will answer fundamental questions in plasticity, most prominently the interplay of deformation and structure in complex crystals, and thereby support the development of new high performance materials.","KORTE-KERZEL Sandra",2019,1499719,"Technical University of Aachen","excluded",NA

Among different contributors, tonal noise is the most important due to regulatory definitions and its attenuation characteristics, with the largest contributor being the fan aero-acoustics. Current passive noise reduction methods alone are insufficient to conform with the increasingly stringent noise emission regulations. This motivates our research in active noise cancellation, based on creation of equal amplitude and frequency pressure waves, in opposite phase to the disturbance. Having identified that the actuator technology is the main hindrance against hardware implementation in flying platforms, we have been investigating a revolutionary technology based on a truly static and surface-deposited sound emitter (thermophone), which creates pressure fields by thermo-acoustic effects rather than the vibro-acoustics utilized by common speakers. Comprising of a periodically Joule heated electrically conductive thin layer, a highly efficient thermophone requires modeling of non-Fourier heat conduction in deposits. The project is divided into 4 multi-disciplinary objectives: 1. Derivation of accurate macro-scale heat conduction model, including non-Fourier effects 2. Developing thermophone performance model by analyzing thermo-acoustic effect 3. Optimization of performance by material and geometric selection, and by manufacturing processes 4. Demonstrating aero-acoustic fan noise cancelation via the thermo-acoustic effect created by static heat flux transducer In addition to the significance that this project will have to the field of aviation, I strongly believe that successful completion of each work package will provide dramatic improvements over the state of the arts in conduction heat transfer modelling, consumer electronics such as speakers, manufacturing methods for thermo-acoustic devices, and active aero-acoustic noise cancellation.","Cukurel Beni",2019,1993265,"Technion - Israel Institute of Technology","excluded",NA

Due to recent advances in digital fabrication techniques, the last years have seen a revolution in artificial periodic composites with on-demand electromagnetic, acoustic, thermal and mechanical properties. These so-called metamaterials become particularly interesting in mechanics, where geometrical effects and nonlinearities are much stronger than in any other physical field. Over the past 5 years, the community -including myself- has discovered a plethora of “extreme” functionalities, e.g. mechanical metamaterials that are very light, stiff and strong at the same time, that have negative elastic moduli or that exhibit programmable shape-changes. Importantly, such advanced properties are typically designed through a purely geometrical framework. Yet, this impressive progress is so far confined to idealized settings, namely for homogeneous boundary conditions, imperfection-free structures and purely elastic constituents under quasi-static driving. This traditional focus severely limits our understanding of metamaterials and their potential for applications. Here, I propose to uncover the extreme mechanics of metamaterials under realistic conditions. Specifically, by generalizing the geometrical framework to allow for deviations from the ideal limit, and by validating it through a wide array of experimental and numerical techniques, I will establish: 1) the effect of inhomogeneous boundary conditions. 2) the sensitivity to geometric imperfections. 3) the role of dissipation. Just as the fundamental understanding of defects and dislocations revolutionized materials science, by exploring perturbations in metamaterials I will push the frontiers of solids mechanics and open up avenues for the design of robust advanced functionalities tailored to realistic complex scenarios, from prosthetics to aerospace.","COULAIS Corentin",2019,1499478,"University of Amsterdam","selected",NA

Mechanobiology, in turn, has revealed mechanical signals as essential players in regulating cellular behavior to guide organogenesis. Accordingly, the ball is in the court of physicists and bioengineers to quantify those mechanical signals and shape tissue growth by tailoring the physical interactions of cells with their environment. Finally, the functionality of the retina has to be quantified via neuroscience techniques. This multifaceted challenge has prevented the establishment of the retina organoid as a biophysical model. ROMB introduces a biophysical model for the retina which I will use to model Alzheimer’s disease in vitro.

These reconfigurable soft materials hold great potential for a large variety of applications from sensing devices to energy harvesting, noise and vibration mitigation, and soft robotics. However, these materials operate at high magnetic fields, thus, limiting potential application of the technology. A promising approach to significantly enhance the magnetomechanical performance, and reduce the required magnetic field, is to design soft magnetoactive composites through architectured microstructures. Highly ordered microstructures are an origin for multiscale magnetomechanical instabilities and possible failure of the materials. In this research proposal, we directly address this crucial aspect for MAE-based technology. Moreover, we declare an ambitious goal: Turning failure into functionalities.

My next goal is to study the energy partition between the creation of bubbles, the formation of liquid jets, and the penetration of these jets into soft substrates. Fundamental insights on energy partitioning will then be applied to achieve major breakthroughs in jet injection, by (1) controlling cavitation within microfluidic confinement, (2) tuning the rheology of jets emerging from confined cavitation, and (3) deriving the relationships between fluid dynamics and material properties governing jet injection into soft substrates.

Moreover, distracted by a race for higher conversion efficiencies, the development of in-vacuum deposition techniques to reproducibly and controllably grow these hybrid films has been highly overlooked. This is now the main hurdle for the full exploration of Pb-free and stable hybrid halides, which might not be as defect tolerant or easily produced by solution process as PbHP.

But, these atomically thin membranes are in essence nonlinear and exhibit nonlinear dynamic behavior at forces of only a few pN, which needs to be understood to harness their full potential. Although the field of nonlinear dynamics dates back several centuries, its implications at the atomic scale have remained relatively unexplored.

The main cause of laminar-turbulent transition on commonly used swept wings is the development of crossflow (CF) instabilities. Despite their importance, our fundamental understanding of CF instabilities is limited due to inability of current measurement techniques to capture their complex and multi-scale spatio-temporal features. This severely limits our ability to delay CF transition, which is further impeded by the lack of simple, robust and efficient control concepts. In this proposal I will achieve unprecedented spatio-temporal measurements of CF instabilities and develop a novel active flow control system that can successfully delay transition on swept wings. To achieve these goals, I bring forth a unique combination of cutting-edge technologies, such as tomographic particle image velocimetry, advanced plasma-based actuators and linear/non-linear stability and control theory. Spatio-temporal volumetric velocity measurements of CF instabilities will be achieved at three important stages of their life, namely inception, growth and breakdown, providing breakthrough insights into the underlying physics of swept wing transition and turbulence production.

CO2RR is also limited by the low solubility of CO2 in the electrolyte solution and therefore electrocatalytic reactions in gas phase using gas diffusion electrodes would be preferred. 2D materials have recently emerged as a novel class of electrocatalytic materials thanks to their rich structures and electronic properties. The synthesis of novel 2D catalysts and their implementation into photocatalytic systems would be a major step towards the development of devices for storing solar energy in the form of chemical fuels. With 2D-4-CO2, I propose to: 1) develop novel class of CO2RR catalysts based on conducting 2D nanosheets and 2) demonstrate photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into chemical fuels using structure engineered gas diffusion electrodes made of 2D conducting catalysts. To reach this goal, the first objective of 2D-4-CO2 is to provide guidelines for the development of novel cutting-edge 2D catalysts towards CO2 conversion into chemical fuel. This will be possible by using a multidisciplinary approach based on 2D materials engineering, advanced methods of characterization and novel designs of gas diffusion electrodes for the reduction of CO2 in gas phase. The second objective is to develop practical photocatalytic systems using van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures for the efficient conversion of CO2 into chemical fuels. vdW heterostructures will consist in rational designs of 2D materials and 2D-like materials deposited by atomic layer deposition in order to achieve highly efficient light conversion and prolonged stability. This project will not only enable a deeper understanding of the CO2RR but it will also provide practical strategies for large-scale application of CO2RR for solar fuel production.","VOIRY Damien",2018,1499931,"National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS)","excluded",NA
"ref_080","BEBOP","Bacterial biofilms in porous structures: from biomechanics to control","The key ideas motivating this project are that: 1) precise control of the properties of porous systems can be obtained by exploiting bacteria and their fantastic abilities. 2) conversely, porous media (large surface to volume ratios, complex structures) could be a major part of bacterial synthetic biology, as a scaffold for growing large quantities of microorganisms in controlled bioreactors. The main scientific obstacle to precise control of such processes is the lack of understanding of biophysical mechanisms in complex porous structures, even in the case of single-strain biofilms. The central hypothesis of this project is that a better fundamental understanding of biofilm biomechanics and physical ecology will yield a novel theoretical basis for engineering and control. The first scientific objective is thus to gain insight into how fluid flow, transport phenomena and biofilms interact within connected multiscale heterogeneous structures - a major scientific challenge with wide-ranging implications. To this end, we will combine microfluidic and 3D printed micro-bioreactor experiments. fluorescence and X-ray imaging. high performance computing blending CFD, individual-based models and pore network approaches. The second scientific objective is to create the primary building blocks toward a control theory of bacteria in porous media and innovative designs of microbial bioreactors. Building upon the previous objective, we first aim to extract from the complexity of biological responses the most universal engineering principles applying to such systems. We will then design a novel porous micro-bioreactor to demonstrate how the permeability and solute residence times can be controlled in a dynamic, reversible and stable way - an initial step toward controlling reaction rates. We envision that this will unlock a new generation of biotechnologies and novel bioreactor designs enabling translation from proof-of-concept synthetic microbiology to industrial processes.","DAVIT Yohan, Jean-Michel, Louis",2018,1649861,"National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS)","excluded",NA
"ref_081","MULT2D","Multiscale Mechanics of Bone Fragility in Type-2 Diabetes","Type-2 (T2) Diabetes is associated with a 3-fold increase in bone fracture risk, despite the fact that bone volume is not reduced. This implies that T2 diabetes impairs bone quality, whereby the intrinsic material properties of the bone matrix are altered. However, current diagnostic techniques are unable to predict fracture probability in T2 diabetes as they are based on measures of bone quantity. While it is believed that non-enzymatic cross-linking of organic proteins (also known as AGE accumulation) in the bone matrix is responsible for bone fragility in T2 diabetes, there is a distinct lack of understanding how altered protein configurations impair whole-bone biomechanics. In this project, the applicant will embark on frontier research that will develop a state-of-the-art multiscale computational framework that couples behaviour from the molecular to whole-bone level, providing a basis to interrogate and elucidate the physical mechanisms that are responsible for diabetic bone fragility. A multiscale experimental framework will, for the first time, establish relationships between AGE crosslink-density and whole-bone fragility in animal and human T2 diabetic bone tissue. Together, this data will inform a probabilistic mutli-level model of hip fracture, which will be used to quantitatively evaluate the relationship between hip fracture probability, bone quantity and bone quality. The research programme will also establish a novel strategy for clinical fracture risk assessment that employs existing protocols to measure bone quantity, in combination with a surrogate measure of bone quality. The surrogate measure of bone quality proposed is a systemic measure of AGE content, which is clinically-obtainable through a blood sample and therefore widely-applicable. Overall, the project will provide a ground-breaking advance in our understanding of bone fragility, with remarkable potential to innovate novel solutions for clinical assessment of T2 diabetic bone disease.","VAUGHAN Ted",2018,1499659,"National University of Ireland, Galway","excluded",NA
"ref_082","HyGate","Hydrophobic Gating in nanochannels: understanding single channel mechanisms for designing better nanoscale sensors","Hydrophobic gating is the phenomenon by which the flux of ions or other molecules through biological ion channels or synthetic nanopores is hindered by the formation of nanoscale bubbles. Recent studies suggest that this is a generic mechanism for the inactivation of a plethora of ion channels, which are all characterized by a strongly hydrophobic interior. The conformation, compliance, and hydrophobicity of the nanochannels – in addition to external parameters such as electric potential, pressure, presence of gases – have a dramatic influence on the probability of opening and closing of the gate. This largely unexplored confined phase transition is known to cause low frequency noise in solid-state nanopores used for DNA sequencing and sensing, limiting their applicability. In biological channels, hydrophobic gating might conspire in determining the high selectivity towards a specific ions or molecules, a characteristic which is sought for in biosensors. The objective of HyGate is to unravel the fundamental mechanisms of hydrophobic gating in model nanopores and biological ion channels and exploit their understanding in order to design biosensors with lower noise and higher selectivity. In order to achieve this ambitious goal, I will deploy the one-of-a-kind simulation and theoretical tools I developed to study vapor nucleation in extreme confinement, which comprises rare-event molecular dynamics and confined nucleation theory. These quantitative tools will be instrumental in designing better biosensors and nanodevices which avoid the formation of nanobubbles or exploit them to achieve exquisite species selectivity. The novel physical insights into the behavior of water in complex nanoconfined environments are expected to inspire radically innovative strategies for nanopore sensing and nanofluidic circuits and to promote a stepwise advancement in the fundamental understanding of hydrophobic gating mechanisms and their influence on bio-electrical cell response.","GIACOMELLO Alberto",2018,1496250,"Sapienza University of Rome","excluded",NA

If felt, induced seismicity has a negative effect on public perception and may jeopardise wellbore stability, which has led to the cancellation of several projects. Forecasting injection-induced earthquakes is a big challenge that must be overcome to deploy geo-energies to significantly reduce CO2 emissions and thus mitigate climate change and reduce related health issues. The basic conjecture is that, while initial (micro)seisms are caused by well-known mechanisms that could be predicted, subsequent activity is caused by harder to understand and, at present, unpredictable coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical-seismic (THMS) processes, which is the reason why available models fail to forecast induced seismicity. The objective of this project is to develop a novel methodology to predict and mitigate induced seismicity. We propose an interdisciplinary approach that integrates the THMS processes that occur in the subsurface as a result of fluid injection. The methodology, based on new analytical and numerical solutions, will concentrate on (1) understanding the processes that lead to induced seismicity by model testing of specific conjectures, (2) improving and extending subsurface characterization by using industrial fluid injection operations as a long-term continuous characterization methodology, so as to reduce prediction uncertainty, and (3) using the resulting understanding and site specific knowledge to predict and mitigate induced seismicity. Project developments will be tested and verified against fluid-induced seismicity at field sites that present diverse characteristics. Arguably, the successful development of this project will provide operators with concepts and tools to perform pressure management to reduce the risk of inducing seismicity to acceptable levels and thus, improve safety and reverse public perception on fluid injection activities.","VILARRASA Victor",2018,1438201,"Spanish National Research Council (CSIC)","excluded",NA

High-performance membranes can reduce the energy penalty for the capture, are environment-friendly (no chemical is used, no waste is generated), can intensify chemical processes, and can be employed for the capture in a decentralized fashion. However, a technological breakthrough is needed to realize such chemically and thermally stable, high-performance membranes. This project seeks to develop the ultimate high-performance membranes for H2/CO2 (pre-combustion capture), CO2/N2 (post-combustion capture), and CO2/CH4 separations (natural gas sweetening). Based on calculations, these membranes will yield a gigantic gas permeance (1 and 0.1 million GPU for the H2 and the CO2 selective membranes, respectively), 1000 and 10-fold higher than that of the state-of-the-art polymeric and nanoporous membranes, respectively, reducing capital expenditure per unit performance and the needed membrane area. For this, we introduce three novel concepts, combining the top-down and the bottom-up crystal engineering approaches to develop size-selective, chemically and thermally stable, nanoporous two-dimensional membranes. First, exfoliated nanoporous 2d nanosheets will be stitched in-plane to synthesize the truly-2d membranes. Second, metal-organic frameworks will be confined across a nanoporous 2d matrix to prepare a composite 2d membrane. Third, atom-thick graphene films with tunable, uniform and size-selective nanopores will be crystallized using a novel thermodynamic equilibrium between the lattice growth and etching. Overall, the innovative concepts developed here will open up several frontiers on the synthesis of high-performance membranes for a wide-range of separation processes.","AGRAWAL Kumar Varoon",2018,1875000,"Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL)","excluded",NA

Masonry structures have been proven the most vulnerable both in the developing and in the developed world. Even though Masonry is one of the oldest building materials, our understanding of its behavior at the level of the structure (system level) is limited. Therefore, there is a need for extended shake table testing. But shake table tests are expensive and full-scale system-level testing of large buildings is only possible in a handful of shake tables in the globe – and at a huge cost. We propose to take advantage of research developments in 3D printing and develop a method to perform system-level testing at a small scale using 3D printers and a geotechnical centrifuge (to preserve similitude). The key is to print materials with behavior controllable and similar to masonry. MiniMasonry testing proposes to control the properties of masonry via controlling the geometry of a 3D printed “meta”-mortar. The method will be developed via typical static masonry tests performed on the 3D printed parts. It will be further validated via comparing shaking table tests (in a centrifuge) of miniature structures to existing results of full-scale tests. The cost of the dynamic tests is expected to be so low, that multiple tests can be performed, so that existing numerical methods can be validated in the statistical sense. As a case study, the method will be applied to explore the behavior of a low-cost seismic isolation method that has been proposed for masonry structures in developing countries. With the rapid evolution of 3D printing, it will be possible to scale-up the methods developed in MiniMasonryTesting, so that other Civil Engineering materials can be tested faster and cheaper than now. This is a game changer in structural testing, as it will enable researchers to test structures that up to now it was impossible or very expensive to test at a system level.","VASSILIOU Michalis",2018,1999477,"Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich)","selected",NA

Many in the community seek new and more accurate ways to describe turbulence. This is a time of re-evaluation and opportunity! The assumed statistical equilibrium of the smallest and intermediate scales is identified as the main cause of the potentially erroneous deductions. This problem was not previously noticed because experiments that confirmed the previous theories were all in statistical equilibrium. And those experiments and theories which disagreed were labelled ‘anomalous’, no matter how carefully performed or argued. The proposed theory-intensive approach will therefore specifically use non-equilibrium and statistically non-stationary flows to: 1. Investigate the underlying mechanisms determining the level of dissipation 2. Quantify the resulting effects on the balance equations of central importance 3. Test the results against the established, as well as competing, theories I will use stationary and accelerating jets well-suited for studying the non-linear interactions and quantifying departures to the assumed equilibrium and the non-stationary dissipation. The feasibility is demonstrated with preliminary results. The databases which will be established should contribute substantially to settling the long-lived ultimate question of turbulence: what are the true underlying mechanisms that set the level of dissipation. The results will be ground breaking scientifically and economically. The impact for engineering applications is extensive, since Kolmogorov-based turbulence models are routinely used, and since developing flows constitute the rule rather than the exception in the majority of engineering applications.

Inertial particle microfluidics (IPMF) is a novel and competitive method with applications in cancer cell and bacteria separation. Yet, the physics behind IPMF is not well understood, making progress slow and costly. Novel design rules are in urgent need to avoid trial-and-error experiments. I will numerically investigate the underlying physical mechanisms and develop the first predictive toolkit for engineering applications of IPMF. In particular, I will address five ambitious challenges in SIRIUS: 1. Develop an accurate numerical model for IPMF. 2. Understand the impact of particle softness. 3. Investigate the effect of finite particle concentration. 4. Improve the currently low separation efficiency of small particles. 5. Develop a toolkit to enable simulation-driven design. These objectives are feasible through novel numerical approaches based on the lattice-Boltzmann method and state-of-the-art high-performance computing. SIRIUS will pursue an innovative simulation campaign, validated with existing experimental data, to generate both physical insight and scaling laws for simulation-driven design. For the first time, SIRIUS will produce robust numerical methods for IPMF.

These materials are key in transport systems, wind power and H storage. Despite the enormous economic significance, little is known fundamentally about the underlying damage mechanisms, which are inherently playing out on the atomic scale. The PI’s team will use atom probe tomography, an atomic scale 3D microscopy method to systematically analyse the location and pathways of H in the microstructure and shed light on damage mechanisms in Fe and Ni based materials. This will include vacancies/clusters (0D), dislocations (1D), interfaces (2D) and second phased (3D). The approach will be combined with micro-mechanics to investigate the involvement of H in fracture behaviour. We will measure the amount of H at dislocations required for enhanced plasticity, in the plastic wake of a crack and at the crack tip. In production materials, we will determine the amount of H at identified traps after processing as well as penetration pathways into the material. Finally, we will clarify the contribution of H to a important problem for wind power generation: white-etching cracks. These experiments are now made possible in a commercial atom probe by using 2H (D) charging combined with cryo specimen transfers to avoid H loss. In the project, the team will go a step further and build an atom probe with ultra-low H background to enable the direct detection of 1H, enabling analysis without tracers. The resulting knowledge will greatly enhance our knowledge on the fundamentals of H in metals at the atomic scale. This will lead to increased predictability of failures, the rational design of H resistant high strength materials and protection measures and with it great cost savings especially in renewable energy generation and electromobility.","FELFER Peter",2018,1497959,"University of Erlangen-Nuremberg","excluded",NA

Flexoelectricity exists in a wider range of centrosymmetric materials especially nontoxic materials useful for biomedical application. It grows dominantly in energy density at submicro- or nanoscale enabling self-powered nano devices such as body implants and small-scale wireless sensors. Among the emerging applications of flexoelectricity, energy harvesters are the basic front devices of wide technological impact.

In the last decade, the global demands for cooling are growing exponentially. The standard refrigeration technology, based on vapour compression, is old, inefficient and environmentally harmful. In the SUPERCOOL project we will exploit the potential of elastocaloric cooling, probably the most promising solid-state refrigeration technology, which utilizes the latent heat associated with the martensitic transformation in superelastic shape-memory alloys. We have already demonstrated a novel concept of utilizing the elastocaloric effect (eCE) by introducing a superelastic porous structure in an elastocaloric regenerative thermodynamic cycle. Our preliminary results, recently published in Nature Energy, show the tremendous potential of such a system. However, two fundamental challenges remain. First, we need to create a geometry of the superelastic porous structure (elastocaloric regenerator) to ensure sufficient fatigue life, a large eCE and rapid heat transfer. Second, we must have a driver mechanism that can effectively utilize the work released during the unloading of the elastocaloric regenerator. To succeed I am proposing a unique approach to design advanced elastocaloric regenerators with complex structures together with a driver mechanism with the force-recovery principle. We will employ a systematic characterization and bottom-up linking of all three crucial aspects of the elastocaloric regenerator, i.e., the thermo-hydraulic properties, the stability and the structural fatigue, together with a new solution for force recovery in effective drivers. Based on these theoretical, numerical and experimental results we will combine both key elements of our novel elastocaloric concept into a prototype device, which could be the first major breakthrough in cooling technologies for 100 years, providing greater efficiency and reduced levels of pollution, by applying a solid-state refrigerant.","TUŠEK Jaka",2018,1359375,"University of Ljubljana","excluded",NA

However, a prevascularization solution to irrigate complex engineered tissues and assure their survival after transplantation is currently elusive. In the human body, complex organs and tissues irrigation is achieved by a network of blood vessels termed capillary bed which suggests such a structure is needed in engineered tissues. Previous approaches to engineer capillary beds reached different levels of success but none yielded a fully functional one due to the inability in simultaneously addressing key elements such as correct angiogenic cell populations, a suitable matrix and dynamic conditions that mimic blood flow. CapBed aims at proposing a new technology to fabricate in vitro capillary beds that include a vascular axis that can be anastomosed with a patient circulation.

Despite their ubiquity, flow and transport in these systems remain at the frontier of our ability to measure and model. A defining feature of soft porous media is that they can experience deformations that transform the pore structure. This has profound implications for the transport and mixing of solutes and the simultaneous flow of multiple fluid phases, both of which are strongly coupled to the pore structure. The goal of this project is to shed new light on flow and transport in soft porous media by studying a series of three canonical flow problems (tracer transport, miscible viscous fingering, and two-phase flow) across soft adaptations of three classical model systems (a soft-walled Hele Shaw cell, a quasi-2D packing of soft beads, and a cylindrical 3D “core” of soft beads). These flow problems and model systems have been thoroughly studied in the context of stiff porous media, allowing us to leverage decades of previous work and focus exclusively on the new behaviour introduced by “softness”. We will collect an extensive set of new, high-resolution experimental observations in each of these model systems, and we will reconcile these observations with mathematical models based on the traditional approach of upscaled constitutive functions. By updating this traditional approach to account for deformation, we will provide a new, pragmatic class of continuum models that capture the leading-order features of flow and transport in soft porous media. Our results will jumpstart the field of flow and transport in soft porous media, breaking open a vast new realm of research questions and applications around understanding, predicting, and controlling these complex systems.","MacMinn Christopher",2018,1482862,"University of Oxford","excluded",NA
"ref_093","UltimateRB","Direct numerical simulations towards ultimate turbulence","Turbulent thermal convection plays an important role in a wide range of natural and industrial settings, from astrophysical and geophysical flows to process engineering. The paradigmatic representation of thermal convection is Rayleigh-Bénard (RB) flow in which a layer of fluid is heated from below and cooled from above. A major challenge is to determine the scaling relation of the Nusselt number (Nu), i.e. the dimensionless heat transport, with the Rayleigh number (Ra), which is the dimensionless temperature difference between the two plates, expressed as Nu∼Ra^γ. Theory predicts that the scaling exponent γ increases for extremely strong driving when the boundary layers transition from laminar to turbulent. Understanding the transition to this so-called ‘ultimate’ regime is crucial since an extrapolation of results from lab-scale experiments and simulations to astro- and geophysical phenomena becomes meaningless when the transition to this ‘ultimate’ state is not understood. So far, there is no consensus among experimental efforts for obtaining the ‘ultimate’ regime. We propose using direct numerical simulations (DNS) to gain a better understanding of the transition towards the ‘ultimate’ regime. While obtaining ‘ultimate’ thermal convection in simulations has been elusive, new developments make this feasible now. The benefit of simulations is that they allow full access to the flow and temperature fields, while all boundary conditions are set exactly and independently. This allows us to test various physical effects at full dynamic similarity. To trigger the excitation of the ‘ultimate’ regime at lower Ra than in standard small aspect ratio cells, we want to study the effect of roughness, additional shear, and large domains in which a stronger flow can develop than in confined small aspect ratio cells that are traditionally considered. The addition of rotation will be studied to disentangle the complicated effect of rotation on high Ra number thermal convection.","STEVENS Richard Johannes Antonius Maria",2018,1499375,"University of Twente","excluded",NA

This project is devised to challenge this idea and establish a new framework which incorporates a deterministic component within the fragmentation mechanisms. In order to check the correctness of this new theory, I will develop a comprehensive experimental, analytical and numerical methodology to address 4 canonical fragmentation problems which respond to distinct geometric and loading conditions which make easily identifiable from a mechanical standpoint. For each canonical problem, I will investigate traditionally-machined and 3D-printed specimens manufactured with 4 different engineering metals widely used in aerospace and civilian-security applications. The goal is to elucidate whether at sufficiently high strain rates there may be a transition in the fragmentation mechanisms from defects–controlled to inertia–controlled. If the new statistical-deterministic framework is proven to be valid, defects may not play the major role in the fragmentation at high strain rates. This would bring down the entry barriers that the 3D-printing technology has found in energy absorption applications, thus reducing production transportation and repairing, energetic and economic costs of protective structures without impairing their energy absorption capacity.

Tests demonstrated that an array of microelectrodes implanted in cortex allows to record activity of the brain and to induce a movement on prosthetic limbs or electrical stimulations restore some visual sensations. For these applications the life time and stability of the electrodes are critical features for the reliable operation of any implantable neuronal device. It’s also necessary to have high density implant with small electrodes to cover a large surface of the cortex to have access of neuronal code. A reliable packaging for long term implantable devices are in titanium or glass but not suitable in the case of ECoG (ElectroCorticoGraphy) implant. Indeed, it is necessary to achieve a polymer implant as a core material, to follow the topology of the brain surface. But in long term the polymer swells and moisture penetrates the implant and degrades its performances therefore reducing the lifetime. The goal of NEURODIAM project is to address two major challenges: - increase the lifetime of implant by a specific packaging, - reduce the size of the electrodes to be equivalent to the neurones size (10 µm) without degradation of noise and consequently increase the electrode density for a fine mapping of the cortex. To avoid performance drift of the implant, a new packaging solution completely hermetic will be developed based on the last developments of micro and nano structuration of diamond layer that combines conductive and intrinsic synthetic diamond. Fast ageing tests will be settled to demonstrate the viability of this diamond technology. In-vitro and in-vivo assessment will be performed to demonstrate the efficiency of these implants for recording and stimulation of neuronal tissue. This project will produce high performance diamond based technology that can be later used for various implants dedicated to fundamental studies in neurosciences.","ROUSSEAU Lionel",2017,1499865,"Chamber of Commerce and Industry Region Paris-Ile-de-France","excluded",NA
"ref_099","MemoMOFEnergy","Constructing polar rotors in metal-organic frameworks for memories and energy harvesting","I seek to develop new ferroelectrics based on metal-organic frameworks with dipolar rotors. Ferroelectrics are targeted to be used as physically flexible memories and mechanical energy harvesters for biocompatible sensors and implantable monitoring devices. As ferroelectrics can store and switch their polarity, they can be used as memories. Via the piezoelectric effect, they can harvest mechanical vibrations. The materials most compatible with flexible substrates, are soft matter materials. However, these so far don’t meet the requirements. Especially lacking is a combination of i) polarisation stability, ii) a sufficiently low energy barrier for polarisation switching and iii) fast switching. As energy harvesters, soft matter materials are hampered by low piezoelectric coefficients. The main objective of this proposal is rational design of ferroelectrics by obtaining a fundamental understanding of the relation between structure and properties. I will achieve this by uniquely synthesizing polar rotors into 3D crystalline scaffolds that allow to alter the rotors’ nano-environement. I will achieve this via polar ligands in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The variability of MOFs allows to tune the nature of the hindrance towards rotation of the polar rotors. The tuneable flexibility allows to regulate the energy harvesting efficiency. Moreover, MOFs have already shown potential as biocompatible materials that can be integrated on physically flexible substrates. The research consists of i) synthesis of polar rotor MOFs with targeted variations, ii) reliable characterisation and computational modelling of the electronic properties, iii) nanoscopic insight in the switching dynamics. The approach allows to understand how ferro- and piezoelectricity are related to the materials’ structure, and hence to develop materials with exceptional performance. My recent observation of the ferroelectric behaviour of a nitrofunctionalised MOF is the basis for this proposal.","VAN DER VEEN Monique",2017,1500000,"Delft University of Technology","excluded",NA

MOFs have very large surface areas, high porosities, various pore sizes/shapes, chemical functionalities and good thermal/chemical stabilities. These properties make MOFs highly promising for gas separation applications. Thousands of MOFs have been synthesized in the last decade. The large number of available MOFs creates excellent opportunities to develop energy-efficient gas separation technologies. On the other hand, it is very challenging to identify the best materials for each gas separation of interest. Considering the continuous rapid increase in the number of synthesized materials, it is practically not possible to test each MOF using purely experimental manners. Highly accurate computational methods are required to identify the most promising MOFs to direct experimental efforts, time and resources to those materials. In this project, I will build a complete MOF library and use molecular simulations to assess adsorption and diffusion properties of gas mixtures in MOFs. Results of simulations will be used to predict adsorbent and membrane properties of MOFs for scientifically and technologically important gas separation processes such as CO2/CH4 (natural gas purification), CO2/N2 (flue gas separation), CO2/H2, CH4/H2 and N2/H2 (hydrogen recovery). I will obtain the fundamental, atomic-level insights into the common features of the top-performing MOFs and establish structure-performance relations. These relations will be used as guidelines to computationally design new MOFs with outstanding separation performances for CO2 capture and H2 recovery. These new MOFs will be finally synthesized in the lab scale and tested as adsorbents and membranes under practical operating conditions for each gas separation of interest. Combining a multi-stage computational approach with experiments, this project will lead to novel, efficient gas separation technologies based on MOFs.","Keskin Avcı Seda",2017,1500000,"KOC UNIVERSITY","excluded",NA

However, very few of these exciting discoveries are translated to commercial medical products today. The main reasons for this are two inherent limitations of most nanomanufacture processes: scalability and reproducibility. There is too little knowledge on how well the unique properties associated with nanoparticles are maintained during their large-scale production while often poor reproducibility hinders their successful use. A key goal here is to utilize a nanomanufacture process famous for its scalability and reproducibility, flame aerosol reactors that produce at tons/hr commodity powders, and advance the knowledge for synthesis of complex nanoparticles and their direct integration in medical devices. Our aim is to develop the next generation of antibacterial medical devices to fight antimicrobial resistance, a highly understudied field. Antimicrobial resistance constitutes the most serious public health threat today with estimations to become the leading cause of human deaths in 30 years. We focus on flame direct nanoparticle deposition on substrates combining nanoparticle production and functional layer deposition in a single-step with close attention to product nanoparticle properties and device assembly, extending beyond the simple commodity powders of the past. Specific targets here are two devices. a) hybrid drug microneedle patch with photothermal nanoparticles to fight life-threatening skin infections from drug-resistant bacteria and b) smart nanocoatings on implants providing both osteogenic and self-triggered antibacterial properties.

In both cases, our ability to study new, optimized solutions based on the specific industrial end-user needs is limited by the absence of theoretical tools able to accurately predict the fluid dynamics and the chemistry involved in nanoparticle formation. Indeed, current knowledge on this fascinating but complex process is still rather incomplete. The proposed research program, FUN-PM, will apply an innovative multi-disciplinary, multi-step approach in order to finally answer many unresolved kinetic questions concerning in particular: 1) formation and growth of molecular PAH precursors. 2) particle inception. 3) subsequent particle growth and oxidation. Each single step will be experimentally isolated taking full advantage of complementary conventional shock tube techniques and up-to-date synchrotron-based detection technologies coupled to a newly constructed high-rate repetition shock tube. If successful, the novel synchrotron-shock tube techniques will be utilized for the first time to obtain unique information on unknown key processes. The experimental results, with extensive theoretical ab-initio calculations on relevant PAH reaction pathways, will constitute the base for the development of a comprehensive, detailed chemical kinetic model for particle chemistry applied to Real Fuels. Such model will improve the prediction capabilities of current CFD codes for use in engine design, fuel reformulation, or industrial process optimization, with considerable benefits to the standards of living of European citizens, the environment, and the EU economy, towards the future of clean transportations and novel nanomaterials.","COMANDINI Andrea",2017,1493838,"National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS)","excluded",NA

This pollutant emission is characterized by a distribution of solid carbon particles with different sizes and shapes, which have negative effects on human health and environment. Controlling such emission represents a societal issue and an industrial challenge that require a deep understanding of the intricate processes underlying soot production in the turbulent flames that generally characterize practical systems. In this context, progress in numerical simulations is essential to the successful design of low-emission combustion systems. Unfortunately, the Large-Eddy Simultations (LES) approach, which has successfully demonstrated its capacity to represent gaseous turbulent combustion processes, is far from being predictive for soot emission. Indeed, soot production in turbulent flames is a complex process which is not easy to be represented with the classical LES strategy: the long time scales and the broad range of length scales place soot processes outside the usual scale ranges of LES subgrid models. In this context, the goal of the present project is to provide new insights on the processes governing soot production in turbulent flames to develop novel LES models, encompassing the state-of-art and allowing reliable predictions of soot in turbulent flames. These objectives will be achieved by: (1) characterizing the turbulence-flame-soot coupling from novel well-controlled experiments employing advanced space and time resolved optical diagnostics. (2) developing new subgrid models based on information extracted from experiments and high-fidelity simulations. (3) validating and applying the developed LES modeling strategy on complex systems. The research results are expected to drastically improve the prediction of soot production in industrial configurations, helping to design new low-emission systems with notably reduced soot levels.","Franzelli Benedetta",2017,1436330,"National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS)","excluded",NA

By embedding ratiometric fluorescent particle-based sensors within 3D scaffolds, the changes in target analyte concentrations can be monitored and used to study the interactions between tumour cells and stromal cells in 3D tumoroids/scaffolds and to monitor response of the cells to drug treatments. I first demonstrated successful fabrication of barcoded capsules for multiplex sensing of H+, K+, and Na+ ions. Next, I demonstrated the use of pH-sensing capsules as valid real time optical reporter tools to sense and monitor intracellular acidification in living cells. Thus, I can fabricate capsule sensors for investigating the role of key analytes that are involved in regulation of crucial physiological mechanisms. In addition, I successfully integrated pH-sensing capsules within 3D nanofibrous matrices and demonstrated their operation under pH switches. INTERCELLMED will engineer 3D scaffolds that do not only sense extracellular pH but are also able to sense K+ and O2 changes.

DFUs are chronic wounds that are often recalcitrant to treatment, which devastatingly results in lower leg amputation. This project builds on the PI’s experience growing matrix from induced-pluripotent stem cell derived (iPS)-fibroblasts and in developing on-demand drug delivery technologies. The aim of this project is to first develop a SiPS: a scaffold from iPS-fibroblast grown matrix, which has never been tested as a source material for scaffolds. iPS-fibroblasts grow a more pro-repair and angiogenic matrix than (non-iPS) adult fibroblasts. The SiPS structure will be bilayered to mimic native skin: dermis made mostly by fibroblasts and epidermis made by keratinocytes. The dermal layer will consist of a porous scaffold with optimised pore size and mechanical properties and the epidermal layer will be film-like, optimised for keratinisation. Second, the SiPS will be functionalised with delivery of plasmid-DNA (platelet derived growth factor gene, pPDGF) to direct angiogenesis on-demand. As DFUs undergo uncoordinated healing, timed pPDGF delivery will guide them through angiogenesis and healing. To achieve this, alginate microparticles, designed to respond to ultrasound by releasing pPDGF, will be interspersed throughout the SiPS. This BONDS will be tested in an in vivo pre-clinical DFU model to confirm its ability to heal wounds by providing cells with the appropriate biomimetic scaffold environment and timed directions for healing. With >100 million current diabetics expected to get a DFU, the BONDS would have a powerful clinical impact.

LASER OPTIMAL offers a renaissance to LA for the practical management of challenging tumors (e.g., pancreatic cancer): it investigates and develops integrated solutions to achieve an effective and selective LA, that thermally destroys the whole tumor mass, while spearing the normal tissue around. The excellent ambition of LASER OPTIMAL is to achieve and merge: a) biocompatible nanoparticles (BNPs) injected in the tumor, to enhance the selective absorption of laser light. b) patient-specific anatomy of tumor and its surrounding, extracted from clinical images, to retrieve the optimal laser settings. c) accurate, fast and real-time heat-transfer model to simulate laser-tissue-BNPs interaction, predict and visualize the treatment dynamics. d) real-time temperature measurement system to monitor LA effects, account for unpredictable physiological events and tune the settings (closed-loop).

We will produce highly active, stable and selective catalysts for the upgrading of lignin – the largest natural source of aromatic chemicals – into commodity chemicals, which will have an important targeted impact. The broader impact of our work will lie in the production of catalytic materials with unprecedented control over the active site architecture. There is an urgent need to provide these cheap, stable, selective, and highly active catalysts for renewable molecule production. Thanks to its availability and relatively low cost, lignocellulosic biomass is an attractive source of renewable carbon. However, unlike petroleum, biomass-derived molecules are highly oxygenated, and often produced in dilute-aqueous streams. Heterogeneous catalysts – the workhorses of the petrochemical industry – are sensitive to water and contain many metals that easily sinter and leach in liquid-phase conditions. The production of renewable chemicals from biomass, especially valuable aromatics, often requires expensive platinum group metals and suffers from low selectivity. Catalyst overcoating presents a potential solution to this problem. Recent breakthroughs using catalyst overcoating with atomic layer deposition (ALD) showed that base metal catalysts can be stabilized against sintering and leaching in liquid phase conditions. However, ALD creates dramatic drops in activity due to excessive coverage, and forms an overcoat that cannot be tuned. Our materials will feature the controlled placement of metal sites (including single atoms), several oxide sites, and even molecular imprints with sub-nanometer precision within highly accessible nanocavities. We anticipate that such materials will create unprecedented opportunities for reducing cost and increasing sustainability in the chemical industry and beyond.","LUTERBACHER Jeremy Scott",2017,1785195,"Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL)","excluded",NA

Controlling the evolution of dislocations, i.e. line-like defects and the carrier of plastic deformation, interacting both among themselves and with other microstructure elements allows tailoring material behaviors on the micro and nanoscale. This is essential for rational design approaches towards next generation materials with superior mechanical properties. For nearly a century, materials scientists have been seeking to understand how dislocation systems evolve. In-situ microscopy now reveals complex dislocation networks in great detail. However, without a sufficiently versatile and general methodology for extracting, assembling and compressing dislocation-related information the analysis of such data often stays at the level of “looking at images” to identify mechanisms or structures. Simulations are increasingly capable of predicting the evolution of dislocations in full detail. Yet, direct comparison, automated analysis or even data transfer between small scale plasticity experiments and simulations is impossible, and a large amount of data cannot be reused. The vision of MuDiLingo is to develop and establish for the first time a Unifying Multiscale Language of Dislocation Microstructures. Bearing analogy to audio data conversion into MP3, this description of dislocations uses statistical methods to determine data compression while preserving the relevant physics. It allows for a completely new type of high-throughput data mining and analysis, tailored to the specifics of dislocation systems. This revolutionary data-driven approach links models and experiments on different length scales thereby guaranteeing true interoperability of simulation and experiment.

Nanomedicine research against cancer focuses on the local targeted delivery of chemotherapeutics to enhance drug efficacy and reduce side effects. Despite all the efforts in the design of chemotherapeutic agents as nanomedicines, hardly any improvement has been translated into benefits for patients’ survival. There is an urgent need for improved carrier systems able to deliver high doses of diagnostic agents and anti-cancer drugs to the tumor. Stimuli responsive carriers are promising candidates since the release of the cargo can be triggered locally in the tumor environment.

This results in growth restriction perpendicular to the axis of the suture and promotes growth parallel to it, causing physical deformation of the cranial and facial skeleton, as well as distortion of the underling brain, with potential detrimental effects on its function: visual loss, sleep apnoea, feeding and breathing difficulties, and neurodevelopment delay. Conventional management of craniosynostosis involves craniofacial surgery delivered by excision of the prematurely fused sutures, multiple bone cuts and remodelling of the skull deformities, with the primary goal of improving patient function, while normalising their appearance. Cranial vault remodelling surgical procedures, aided by internal and external devices, have proven functionally and aesthetically effective in correcting skull deformities, but final results remain unpredictable and often suboptimal because of an incomplete understanding of the biomechanical interaction between the device and the skull.

EPIC is uniquely placed to address these problems. A novel constant-volume chamber, offering realistic engine passages but with optical access, and which emulates the pressure/temperature time curve of a real engine, will be developed.

Yet, roughness controls many aspects of engineered devices, such as friction, adhesion, wear and fatigue. Engineering roughness in surface finishing processes is costly and resource intensive. Eliminating finishing steps by controlling roughness in primary shaping or in subsequent wear processes could therefore revolutionize the way we manufacture, but this requires a deep understanding of the relevant processes that is presently lacking. Roughness emerges during mechanical deformation in processes such as folding, scratching or chipping that shape surfaces. Deformation occurs in the form of avalanches, individual bursts of irreversible motion of atoms. The central hypothesis of this project is that roughness is intrinsically linked to these deformation avalanches, which themselves are well-documented to be fractal objects. This hypothesis will be tested in large-scale atomic- and mesoscale simulations of plastic forming and fracture on state of the art high performance computing platforms. Results of these calculations will be used to develop process models for evolving the topography of large surface areas under the action of an external mechanical force, such as experienced in shaping, finishing or wear.

In metals, kinetics is connected to diffusion via atomic lattice vacancies. However, there is no universal sound and predictive physical understanding of the kinetics under non-equilibrium situations so far, because theory cannot be verified experimentally. The in-situ measuring of non-equilibrium vacancy evolution is not possible at industrially relevant and controlled high thermal rates today. Moreover, direct microscopic observation of vacancies in bulk metals has not yet been achieved. The development of unique strategies for in-situ measuring of non-equilibrium vacancy evolution and the microscopic observation of atomic lattice vacancies and their motion will be the main breakthroughs of TRANSDESIGN.

A soft robotic visual system with hydrogel-based adaptive optical elements and ultraflexible photosensor arrays will allow robots to see while grasping. Autonomous operation will be a central question in soft systems, tackled with tough stretchable batteries and energy harvesting from mechanical motion on small and large scales with soft membranes.

Fast actions are required to decrease the concentration of this greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, value that has currently reaching 400 ppm. Among the technological possibilities that are on the table to reduce CO2 emissions, carbon capture and storage into geological deposits is one of the main strategies that is being applied. However, the final objective of this strategy is to remove CO2 without considering the enormous potential of this molecule as a source of carbon for the production of valuable compounds. Nature has developed an effective and equilibrated mechanism to concentrate CO2 and fixate the inorganic carbon into organic material (e.g., glucose) by means of enzymatic action. Mimicking Nature and take advantage of millions of years of evolution should be considered as a basic starting point in the development of smart and highly effective processes. In addition, the use of amino-acid salts for CO2 capture is envisaged as a potential approach to recover CO2 in the form of (bi)carbonates. The project CO2LIFE presents the overall objective of developing a chemical process that converts carbon dioxide into valuable molecules using membrane technology. The strategy followed in this project is two-fold: i) CO2 membrane-based absorption-crystallization process on basis of using amino-acid salts, and ii) CO2 conversion into glucose or salts by using enzymes as catalysts supported on or retained by membranes. The final product, i.e. (bi)carbonates or glucose, has a large interest in the (bio)chemical industry, thus, new CO2 emissions are avoided and the carbon cycle is closed.

We can be leaders of discoveries that translate into advances in the understanding of disease and improving human health. Engineers might use different language and tools than Life Sciences Scientists but we find a common ground, as the laws of Thermodynamics, Physics, and Mathematics also apply to biological phenomena. The development of microbioreactors (μBRs) reconstructing biologically sound niches can revolutionize medical research. In our bodies cells reside in a complex milieu, the microenvironment (μEnv), regulating their fate and function. Most of this complexity is lacking in standard laboratory models, leading to readouts poorly predicting the in vivo situation. This is particularly felt in cancer research, as tumors are extremely heterogeneous and capable of conditioning both the local μEnv and distant organs. Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common and difficult to cure pediatric malignant solid tumor. Secreted exosomes are means by which NBs reshape their μEnv and induce local and long-range changes in cells, regulating progression and prognosis. But the mechanisms involved are yet not completely understood. A major limitation is the difficulty to model in vitro the local in vivo dynamic μEnv. We hypothesize that μBRs exploiting classical engineering principles will solve the limitations of existing classical culture models. We propose to develop platforms and test their edge over classical approaches in decoding the role of exosomes and μEnv in NB. Our μBRs generate time and space-resolved concentration gradients, support fast dynamic changes and reconstruct complex interactions between cells and tissues while performing multifactorial and parallelized experiments. We expect that our technologies will bridge the gap between in vitro techniques and in vivo biological phenomena leading to significant and novel results, shedding light on previously unexplored scenarios.","CIMETTA Elisa",2017,1446250,"University of Padua","excluded",NA

These unique fully wood-based multi-component filaments are accessible via a novel ionic liquid-based dry-jet wet spinning technique. The process provides the possibility to orientate lignin and hemicellulose embedded in a cellulose matrix. The special morphology of the resulting composite filaments is envisioned to increase the mechanical properties of thereof derived carbon fibers significantly, targeting 2000 MPa tensile strength and 200 GPa tensile modulus. These bio-based, low cost carbon fibers will reduce the dependency on non-renewable petroleum-based feedstocks and are highly suitable for lightweight applications in the automotive, sports and leisure sectors. Most distinctively, our technique also enables us to spin wood almost in its native form. Thus, the pretreatment steps and intensity can be reduced drastically and pronounced synergistic effects between the bio-polymers are created. This will lead to higher carbon yields and a significantly enhanced graphitization. In very recent initial trials on a continuous single tow carbonization line we found indicators that the oxidation step, typically accounting for almost 50% of the carbonization heating energy costs, can be reduced or omitted completely depending on the lignin content of the precursor fiber. This – in combination with activated wood as low cost raw material – would be the absolute game changer in developing low-cost, bio-based carbon fibers. In this project the PI, who has developed the spinning technique and a strong background in organic chemistry and spinning physics, will lead a group of 2 PhD students and 1 Postdoc.

These important challenges correspond to capabilities that have been considered essential to fulfil the European strategic goals of future transportation. The main objective is to generate optimal quality curved adapted meshes for space-time flow simulations by addressing the following ambitious and beyond the state of the art 4-dimensional meshing research objectives: curved geometry representation and approximation, mesh quality measures, adapted mesh resolution, and space-time flow simulation. This is a high risk project since it tackles meshing objectives in 4D while lower dimension versions of these issues have not yet been fully solved. However, providing the foundations and the methods to improve current space-time meshing algorithms will suppose a high gain in the field of computational and aerospace engineering. This is so since in the near future, it will be of major importance to conduct accurate, robust, and efficient parallel in space-time adapted flow simulations that exploit the computational power of the exascale super-computing facilities to come.

ELECTRON4WATER proposes a pioneering, chemical-free water purification technology: a three-dimensional (3D) nanoelectrochemical system equipped with low-cost reduced graphene oxide (RGO)-based electrodes. Existing research on graphene-based electrodes has been focused on supercapacitor applications and synthesis of defect-free, superconductive graphene. I will, on the contrary, use the defective structure of RGO to induce the production of reactive oxygen species and enhance electrocatalytic degradation of pollutants. I will investigate for the first time the electrolysis reactions at 3D electrochemically polarized RGO-coated material, which offers high catalytic activity and high surface area available for electrolysis. This breakthrough approach in electrochemical reactor design is expected to greatly enhance the current efficiency and achieve complete removal of persistent contaminants and pathogens from water without using any chemicals, just by applying the current. Also, high capacitance of RGO-based material can enable further energy savings and allow using intermittent energy sources such as photovoltaic panels. These features make 3D nanoelectrochemical systems particularly interesting for distributed, small-scale applications. This project will aim at: i) designing the optimum RGO-based material for specific treatment goals, ii) mechanistic understanding of (electro)catalysis and (electro)sorption of persistent pollutants at RGO and electrochemically polarized RGO, iii) understanding the role of inorganic and organic matrix and recognizing potential process limitations, and iv) developing tailored, adaptable solutions for the treatment of contaminated water.","RADJENOVIC Jelena",2016,1493734,"Catalan Institute of Water Research (ICRA)","excluded",NA

Crystallisation represents one of the most important separation processes in the chemical industry and will play a critical role in the circular economy through enabling the recovery of resources from wastewater to yield an array of sustainable low cost chemicals for use in European industries. Existing crystallisation reactor designs suffer from imperfect mixing and inhomogeneous solvent removal which makes control of crystal quality and consistency problematic and can limit application of the final product. Membrane crystallisation reactor technology is a disruptive innovation that combines process intensification with the capability to achieve significant control over the crystallisation process at a fraction of the scale thus ameliorating many of the problems associated with existing crystallisers. However, before this disruptive membrane based technology can be realised at full scale, there is a critical need to understand the role of shear forces in mediating the growth and harvesting of crystals at the solvent-membrane boundary which has to date received little attention. With no reliable and accurate description of the shear force behaviour within the boundary layer, there is considerable risk incurred in the scaling up of membrane crystallisation reactor design which could lead to inconsistent and inefficient performance. Development of the novel non-invasive, real-time direct observation methodology will enable direct measurement of these discrete forces. The arising new knowledge will be challenged at various process sizes to evolve the science underlying process scale-up of membrane crystallisers and in doing so will deliver internationally competitive research, placing the applicant at the forefront of his academic field.","MCADAM Ewan James",2016,1499655,"Cranfield University","excluded",NA

Our understanding of how these extremely thin and flexible objects are processed in flow is however inadequate, and this is hindering progress towards true market applications. When processed in liquid environments to make nanocomposites, conductive coatings and energy storage devices, 2D nanomaterials tend to fold and break owing to strong shear forces produced by the mechanical agitation of the liquid. This can lead to poorly-oriented, crumpled sheets of small lateral size and therefore of low intrinsic value. Orientation is also a major issue, as ultra-flexible materials are difficult to extend and align. In this project, I will develop nanoscale fluid-structure simulation techniques to capture with unprecedented resolution the unsteady deformation and fracture dynamics of single and multiple sheets in response to the complex hydrodynamic load produced by shearing flows. In addition, I will demonstrate via simulations new strategies to exploit capillary forces to structure 2D nanomaterials into 3D constructs of desired morphology. To guide the simulations and explore a wider parameter space than allowed in computations, I will develop conceptually new experiments on “scaled-up 2D nanomaterials”, macroscopic particles having the same dynamics as the nanoscopic ones. The simulations will include continuum treatments and atomistic details, and will be analysed within the theoretical framework of microhydrodynamics and non-linear solid mechanics.

Embedding sensors in smart architectures that record the stimulus from the environment and transform it into action is the objective of artificial skins. At the moment, different sensors have to be implemented in the artificial skin matrix for each stimulus. The goal of this project is to develop a single multi-stimuli responsive material, which would allow a simplification of the artificial skin and enable unprecedented spatial resolution. The material will be comprised of a smart core, responsive to temperature and humidity, and a piezoelectric shell for pressure sensing. The swelling of the smart core upon stimuli will be sensed by the piezoelectric shell and produce a measurable potential. This architecture will be achieved thanks to the use of novel vapor-based technologies for material processing that allow fabrication at the nanoscale. The advantage of using a dry, vapor-based, polymerization for the smart core is that it will be possible to cumulate different functionalities and engineered composition gradients, which are difficult to obtain by conventional synthesis. Nano-structuration of such materials in core-shell site-specific arrays will allow to create a sensing network with spatial resolution down to 1mm and lower. The network will respond to the stimuli coming from the environment and recognize them in terms of location and type of stimuli.

Among them, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive and lethal, characterized by extensive infiltration into the brain parenchyma. Under the standard treatment protocols, GBM patients can expect a median survival of 14.6 months, while less than 5% of patients live longer than 5 years. This poor prognosis is due to several factors, including the highly aggressive and infiltrative nature of GBM, resulting in incomplete resection, and the limited delivery of therapeutics across the blood-brain-barrier (BBB). The present project aims at addressing these therapeutic challenges by proposing a nanotechnology-based approach for the treatment of GBM, focused on the selective uptake of drug-loaded multifunctional magnetic solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs). An external magnetic guidance will help the SLN accumulation on the cerebral endothelium, where, owing to their lipid nature, they will be allowed to enter the CNS. Here, appropriate surface ligands will drive their internalization inside cancer cells. The chemotherapeutic payload will undergo release, allowing a targeted pharmaceutical treatment that will be combined to hyperthermia upon appropriate radiofrequency application. A synergic attack against GBM will thus be performed, consisting of a chemical attack thanks to the drug, and a physical attack thanks to hyperthermia, that will dramatically enhance the possibilities of therapeutic success. By demonstrating the effectiveness of the platform to cross the BBB and to support tumor regression, a huge impact on human healthcare is envisioned. Moreover, further outcomes of this project are expected by considering the development of nanotechnology-based, multi-functional solutions that can easily be adapted to many other high-impact diseases, in particular at the brain level, where BBB crossing poses a crucial obstacle to many therapeutic approaches.","CIOFANI Gianni",2016,1499997,"Italian Institute of Technology","excluded",NA

So do autophoretic microswimmers, an example of active microscopic particles that draw their motion from physico-chemical exchanges with their environment. How do such ``active fluids'' turn individual microscopic propulsion into macroscopic fluid dynamics? What controls this self-organization process? These are fundamental questions for biologists but also for engineers, to use these suspensions for mixing or chemical sensing and, more generally, for creating active fluids whose macroscopic physical properties can be controlled precisely. Self-propulsion of autophoretic swimmers was reported only recently. Major scientific gaps impair the quantitative understanding of their individual and collective dynamics, which is required to exploit these active fluids. Existing models scarcely account for important experimental characteristics such as complex hydrodynamics, physico-chemical processes and confinement. Thus, these models cannot yet be used as predictive tools, even at the individual level. Further, to use phoretic suspensions as active fluids with microscopically-controlled properties, quantitatively-predictive models are needed for the collective dynamics. Instead of ad-hoc interaction rules, collective models must be built on a detailed physico-mechanical description of each swimmer’s interaction with its environment. This project will develop these tools and validate them against experimental data. This requires overcoming several major challenges: the diversity of electro-chemical processes, the confined geometry, the large number of particles, and the plurality of interaction mechanisms and their nonlinear coupling.

New sustainable battery chemistries must be developed and the most appealing alternatives are to use Ca or Mg metal anodes which would bring a breakthrough in terms of energy density relying on much more abundant elements. Since Mg and Ca do not appear to be plagued by dendrite formation like Li, metal anodes could thus safely be used. While standard electrolytes forming stable passivation layers at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces enabled the success of the Li-ion technology, the migration of divalent cations through a passivation layer was thought to be impossible. Thus, all research efforts to date have been devoted to the formulation of electrolytes that do not form such layer. This approach comes with complex electrolyte, highly corrosive and with narrow electrochemical stability window leading to incompatibility with high voltage cathodes thus penalizing energy density. The applicant demonstrated that calcium can be reversibly plated and stripped through a stable passivation layer when transport properties within the electrolyte are tuned (decreasing ion pair formation). CAMBAT aims at developing new electrolytes forming stable passivation layers and allowing the migration of Ca2+ and Mg2+.

Nonetheless, their implementation in the consumer electronic industry is hampered by the limited control over brightness, colour quality and directionality of LED emission that conventional optical elements relying on geometrical optics provide. This project exploits new ways of controlling the emission characteristics of nanophosphors, surpassing the limits imposed by conventional optics, through the use of exciting nanophotonic concepts - an approach that has not been explored so far due to the strong multiple light-scattering that standard micrometre-sized phosphors present. The development of reliable and scalable nanophosphor-based photonic materials will allow ultimate spectral and angular control over the light emission properties, addressing the critical shortcomings of current LEDs.

To prove and on-demand control over the colour appearance and the angular emission pattern of emitting devices, the project will culminate in an experimental demonstration of two paradigmatic cases: i) directional white-light emission within a narrow angular cone. ii) omnidirectional emission of monochromatic light.

This will make for a versatile, universal test, cheap enough to be used for preventive screening. It will help diagnosing different types of cancers earlier. We will detect and identify oncoviruses capsides, different protein biomarkers and microRNA in plasma. These are very high impact proof of concepts with clinical relevance.

"ref_137","Extreme","An Exascale aware and Un-crashable Space-Time-Adaptive Discontinuous Spectral Element Solver for Non-Linear Conservation Laws","The dynamics of fluids and plasma is described by non-linear conservation laws. Transient behaviour on multiple scales involving turbulence and shocks is intrinsic to these problems. Due to their low dispersion and dissipation errors, adaptive high order numerical methods currently receive growing attention in academia and industry and form an emerging key technology. The potential benefits are massively improved computational efficiency and drastic reduction in memory consumption. Both benefits can be easily justified theoretically, in particular for a space-time adaptive high order method. However, due to high algorithmic complexity, the theoretical performance is difficult to sustain on massively parallel supercomputers. The first challenge that we will address in this project is to design novel, exascale aware, space-time adaptive algorithms and implement them in an open source solver that will scale on over 10^6 computing cores. Another indispensable property for the successful industrialisation of space-time adaptive high order methods is robustness. Robustness, i.e. an un-crashable solver, which still retains all the positive benefits of the high order scheme is the holy grail of the current research on these methods. This requires new mathematical concepts. The second challenge we will address here is to construct a provable un-crashable, space-time adaptive, high order solver without excessive artificial dissipation. Our mathematical key to achieve robustness is not intuitive at first sight: skew-symmetry. We will show that a specific skew-symmetric formulation guided by careful mathematics will allow us to design methods that are consistent with the second law of thermodynamics. This physical consistency is important as it will enable us to construct a new class of un-crashable space-time adaptive high order methods. We will demonstrate the supremacy of this efficient and robust solver in complex large scale science and engineering applications.","GASSNER Gregor",2016,1495875,"University of Koeln","excluded",NA

Reliable material assembly is a great challenge in the development of innovative technologies. The interdiffusion microstructures formed at material interfaces are critical for the performance of the product. However, as more and more elements are involved, their complexity increases and their variety becomes immense. Furthermore, interdiffusion microstructures evolve during processing and in use of the device. Experimental testing of the long-term evolution in assembled devices is extremely time-consuming. The current level of materials models and simulation techniques does not allow in silico (or computer aided) design of multi-component material assemblies, since the parameter space is much too large. With this project, I aim a break-through in computational materials science, using tensor decomposition techniques emerging in data-analysis to guide efficiently high-throughput interdiffusion microstructure simulation studies. The measurable outcomes aimed at, are 1) a high-performance computing software that allows to compute the effect of a huge number of material and process parameters, sufficiently large for reliable in-silico design of multi-materials, on the interdiffusion microstructure evolution, based on a tractable number of simulations, and 2) decomposed tensor descriptions for important multi-material systems enabling reliable computation of interdiffusion microstructure characteristics using a single computer. If successful, the outcomes of this project will allow to significantly accelerate the design of innovative multi-materials. My expertise in microstructure simulations and multi-component materials, and access to collaborations with the top experts in tensor decomposition techniques and materials characterization are crucial to reach this ambitious aim.","Moelans Nele Marie",2016,1496875,"University of Leuven","selected",NA
"ref_139","VirBAcous","Virtual building acoustics: a robust and efficient analysis and optimization framework for noise transmission reduction","Achieving a sufficient sound insulation of buildings is a complex problem since multiple transmission paths are important, uncertainties can have a large effect, and acoustic performance requirements often conflict with structural and thermal requirements. Furthermore, accurate vibro-acoustic modelling across the entire building acoustics frequency range presently requires a huge computational effort. As a result, the acoustic development of building systems is usually based on general design rules, insufficiently accurate prediction models and many experimental prototype tests. Such development is costly and time consuming, and leads to suboptimal designs. This project therefore aims to develop an efficient yet sufficiently accurate prediction framework for the acoustic design of building systems which takes all uncertainties into account and which opens the way for design optimization. Four fundamental breakthroughs are required. First, a new approach to high-frequency subsystem modelling will overcome the limitations of the current statistical energy analysis paradigm and handle a high degree of geometric and material complexity. Second, a modelling framework for built-up systems will be developed, which incorporates different component model types and which switches between them as the frequency increases. The third development consists of quantifying the combined effect of all uncertain parameters on the overall sound insulation performance in a logically consistent and computationally efficient way. Finally, a robust optimization approach that spans the entire building acoustics frequency range and that accounts for all relevant non-acoustic performance criteria as well will be developed. Each development will be complemented by showcase applications in building acoustics, yet the fundamental nature of the developments make that they will have a profound impact in all disciplines where the study and/or control of mechanical wave propagation are important.","REYNDERS Edwin",2016,1386875,"University of Leuven","excluded",NA
"ref_140","ALUFIX","Friction stir processing based local damage mitigation and healing in aluminium alloys","ALUFIX proposes an original strategy for the development of aluminium-based materials involving damage mitigation and extrinsic self-healing concepts exploiting the new opportunities of the solid-state friction stir process. Friction stir processing locally extrudes and drags material from the front to the back and around the tool pin. It involves short duration at moderate temperatures (typically 80% of the melting temperature), fast cooling rates and large plastic deformations leading to far out-of-equilibrium microstructures. The idea is that commercial aluminium alloys can be locally improved and healed in regions of stress concentration where damage is likely to occur. Self-healing in metal-based materials is still in its infancy and existing strategies can hardly be extended to applications. Friction stir processing can enhance the damage and fatigue resistance of aluminium alloys by microstructure homogenisation and refinement. In parallel, friction stir processing can be used to integrate secondary phases in an aluminium matrix. In the ALUFIX project, healing phases will thus be integrated in aluminium in addition to refining and homogenising the microstructure. The “local stress management strategy” favours crack closure and crack deviation at the sub-millimetre scale thanks to a controlled residual stress field. The “transient liquid healing agent” strategy involves the in-situ generation of an out-of-equilibrium compositionally graded microstructure at the aluminium/healing agent interface capable of liquid-phase healing after a thermal treatment. Along the road, a variety of new scientific questions concerning the damage mechanisms will have to be addressed.","SIMAR Aude",2016,1497446,"University of Louvain","excluded",NA
"ref_141","SAMBA","Sustainable and Advanced Membranes By Aqueous Phase Separation","Membranes play a critical role in the production of safe drinking water and in the treatment of human waste streams. However, membranes themselves are nearly always produced using costly, harmful and environmentally unfriendly aprotic solvents such as N-methyl-pyrrolidone (NMP), dimethylformamide (DMF), or dimethylacetamide (DMAC). This proposal describes a highly novel approach allowing the production of the next generation of advanced membranes without the need to use any organic solvents. Here we make use of so-called responsive polymers that can switch under aqueous conditions from a hydrophilic to a hydrophobic state by a simple change of, for example, pH. In the hydrophilic state, water dissolves the polymers and the so obtained solution can be cast as a thin film. Sudden immersion in a bath at a pH where the polymer becomes hydrophobic, leads to very sudden phase separation whereby the polymer coagulates into a porous film, a membrane. Control over the kinetics of this aqueous phase separation process allows for the fabrication of a large variety of porous structures. Furthermore, this process also works for two oppositely charged polymers, where polyelectrolyte complexation is used to induce phase separation. Crosslinking will be a natural way to guarantee membrane stability but can also be used to further modify/improve membranes. The very nature of this aqueous phase separation process is such that membrane additives that are typically associated with advanced membranes (responsive polymers, enzymes, polyzwitterions, metallic nanoparticles) can readily be incorporated. As such, aqueous phase separation not only allows solvent free membrane production, it also provides a very simple and versatile route for the production of membranes with advanced properties. Finally, the porous structures and novel materials developed within this project could be directly useful for other applications, ranging from adsorption processes and coatings to biomedical materials.","DE VOS WIEBE MATTHIJS",2016,1500000,"University of Twente","excluded",NA

This project introduces a new class of meta-materials called meta-biomaterials. Meta-biomaterials go beyond meta-materials by adding an extra dimension to the complex 3D structure, i.e. complex and precisely controlled surface nano-patterns. The 3D structure gives rise to unprecedented or rare combination of mechanical (e.g. stiffness), mass transport (e.g. permeability, diffusivity), and biological (e.g. tissue regeneration rate) properties. Those properties optimize the distribution of mechanical loads and the transport of nutrients and oxygen while providing geometrical shapes preferable for tissue regeneration (e.g. higher curvatures). Surface nano-patterns communicate with (stem) cells, control their differentiation behavior, and enhance tissue regeneration. There is one important problem: meta-biomaterials cannot be manufactured with current technology. 3D printing can create complex shapes while nanolithography creates complex surface nano-patterns down to a few nanometers but only on flat surfaces. There is, however, no way of combining complex shapes with complex surface nano-patterns. The groundbreaking nature of this project is in solving that deadlock using the Origami concept (the ancient Japanese art of paper folding). In this approach, I first decorate flat 3D-printed sheets with nano-patterns. Then, I apply Origami techniques to fold the decorated flat sheet and create complex 3D shapes. The sheet knows how to self-fold to the desired structure when subjected to compression, owing to pre-designed joints, crease patterns, and thickness/material distributions that control its mechanical instability.

These give rise to large pressure fluctuations that can drastically reduce the operable range and threaten the structural integrity of stationary gas turbines and aero engines. In the last 6 years the development of laboratory-scale annular combustors and high-performance computing based on Large Eddy Simulations (LES) have been able to reproduce thermoacoustic oscillations in annular combustion chambers, giving us unprecedented access to information about their nature. Until now, it has been assumed that a complete understanding of thermoacoustic instabilities could be developed by studying the response of single axisymmetric flames. Consequently stability issues crop up far into engine development programmes, or in service, because we lack the knowledge to predict their occurrence at the design stage. However, the ability to experimentally study thermoacoustic instabilities in laboratory-scale annular combustors using modern experimental methods has set the stage for a breakthrough in our scientific understanding capable of yielding truly predictive tools. This proposal aims to break the existing paradigm of studying isolated flames and provide a step change in our scientific understanding by studying thermoacoustic instabilities in annular chambers where the full multiphysics of the problem are present. The technical goals of the proposal are: to develop a novel annular facility with engine relevant boundary conditions. to use this to radically increase our understanding of the underlying physics and flame response, paving the way for the next generation of predictive methods. and to exploit this understanding to improve system stability through intelligent design. Through these goals the proposal will provide an essential bridge between academic and industrial research and strengthening European thermoacoustic expertises.","Worth Nicholas",2015,1929103,"Norwegian University of Science and Technology","excluded",NA

Future space activities progress thanks to space transfer and are safeguarded by space situation awareness. Natural orbit perturbations are responsible for the trajectory divergence from the nominal two-body problem, increasing the requirements for orbit control. whereas, in space situation awareness, they influence the orbit evolution of space debris that could cause hazard to operational spacecraft and near Earth objects that may intersect the Earth. However, this project proposes to leverage the dynamics of natural orbit perturbations to significantly reduce current extreme high mission cost and create new opportunities for space exploration and exploitation. The COMPASS project will bridge over the disciplines of orbital dynamics, dynamical systems theory, optimisation and space mission design by developing novel techniques for orbit manoeuvring by “surfing” through orbit perturbations. The use of semi-analytical techniques and tools of dynamical systems theory will lay the foundation for a new understanding of the dynamics of orbit perturbations. We will develop an optimiser that progressively explores the phase space and, though spacecraft parameters and propulsion manoeuvres, governs the effect of perturbations to reach the desired orbit. It is the ambition of COMPASS to radically change the current space mission design philosophy: from counteracting disturbances, to exploiting natural and artificial perturbations. COMPASS will benefit from the extensive international network of the PI, including the ESA, NASA, JAXA, CNES, and the UK space agency. Indeed, the proposed idea of optimal navigation through orbit perturbations will address various major engineering challenges in space situation awareness, for application to space debris evolution and mitigation, missions to asteroids for their detection, exploration and deflection, and in space transfers, for perturbation-enhanced trajectory design.","Colombo Camilla",2015,1499020,"Polytechnic University of Milan","excluded",NA

In reality, the catalyst is dynamic by changing its structure, shape and size in response to the different conditions in the reactor. Thus, the inclusion of such effects within the framework of microkinetic modelling, albeit extremely complex, is of outmost importance in the quest of engineering the chemical transformation at the molecular level. This proposal aims to approach this grand challenge by developing a hierarchical multiscale methodology for the structure-dependent microkinetic modelling of catalytic processes in applied catalysis. In particular this challenging objective will be achieved by acting on two main fronts: i. development of a hierarchical multiscale methodology for the prediction of the structural changes of the catalyst material as a function of the operating conditions in the reactor and the analysis of the structure-activity relations through the development of structure-dependent microkinetic models. ii. show the applicability of the methodology by the assessment of the structure-activity relation in the context of relevant processes in energy applications such as the short-contact-time CH4 reforming with H2O and CO2 on supported-metal catalysts. The inherent complexity of the problem will be tackled by hierarchically combining novel methods at different levels of accuracy in a dual feed-back loop between theory and experiments. This will require interdisciplinary efforts in bridging among surface science, physical-chemistry and chemical engineering. The fundamental nature and impact of the methodology will be unprecedented and will pave the way toward the detailed analysis and design of the structure-activity relation by tuning shape and size to tailoring activity and selectivity.","Maestri Matteo",2015,1496250,"Polytechnic University of Milan","excluded",NA

Nonetheless, wind turbine (WT) facilities are conjoined with a number of shortcomings relating to their short life-span and the lack of efficient management schemes. With a number of WTs currently reaching their design span, stakeholders and policy makers are convinced of the necessity for reliable life-cycle assessment methodologies. However, existing tools have not yet caught up with the maturity of the WT technology, leaving visual inspection and offline non-destructive evaluation methods as the norm.

We harness light to control light, by making use of photoactuable liquid-crystal elastomers, which display large light-induced deformations through coupling between anisotropic liquid-crystal order and elasticity brought about by the polymer network. We will take liquid-crystal elastomers into a new context by intertwining photomechanics and photonics. Specifically, PHOTOTUNE is built around the following two objectives: (i) Tunable photonic bandgaps and lasing in photoactuable layered structures: The aim is to take photomechanical materials into the scale of optical wavelengths and utilize them in thickness-tunable liquid-crystal elastomer films. Such films will be further integrated into layered structures to obtain photonic crystals and multilayer distributed feedback lasers whose properties can be tuned by light.

Counterbalancing actions are urgently required to reverse them. The objective of this proposal is to develop intelligent window insulation technologies from sustainable materials. The developed technologies will adjust the amount of radiation escaping or entering a window depending upon the ambient environmental conditions and will be capable of delivering unprecedented reductions to the energy needed for regulating the temperature in commercial and residential buildings. Recognising the distinct requirements between newly built and existing infrastructure, two parallel concepts will be developed: i) A new class of intelligent glazing for new window installations, and, ii) a flexible, intelligent, polymer film to retrofit existing window installations.

Despite the impressive progress made in molecular engineering during the last few decades, the quest for a general tool-box technology to study, control and monitor crystallisation processes as well as to isolate metastable states (dynamic capture) is still incomplete. That is because crystalline assemblies are frequently investigated in their equilibrium form, driving the system to its minimum energy state. This methodology limits the emergence of new chemicals and crystals with advanced functionalities, and thus hampers advances in the field of materials engineering. µ-CrysFact will develop tool-box technologies where diffusion-limited and kinetically controlled environments will be achieved during crystallisation and where the isolation of non-equilibrium species will be facilitated by pushing crystallisation processes out of equilibrium. In addition, µ-CrysFact’s technologies will be used to localise, integrate and chemically treat crystals with the aim of honing their functionality.

Small UAVs have the potential to dramatically change current practices in many areas such as, search and rescue, surveillance, and environmental monitoring. Currently the utility of these systems is limited by their operational endurance and their inability to operate in strong turbulent winds, especially those that often occur in urban environments. Birds are adapted to be able to fly in these conditions and actually use them to their advantage to minimise their energy output.

Thermal changes due to pressure-driven phase transitions in fluids have long been used in vapour compression systems to achieve continuous refrigeration and air conditioning, but their energy efficiency is relatively low, and the working fluids that are employed harm the environment when released to the atmosphere. More recently, the discovery of large thermal changes due to pressure-driven phase transitions in magnetic solids has led to suggestions for environmentally friendly solid-state cooling applications. However, for this new cooling technology to succeed, it is still necessary to find suitable barocaloric (BC) materials that satisfy the demanding requirements set by applications, namely very large thermal changes in inexpensive materials that occur near room temperature in response to small applied pressures. I aim to develop new BC materials by exploiting phase transitions in non-magnetic solids whose structural and thermal properties are strongly coupled, namely ferroelectric salts, molecular crystals and hybrid materials. These materials are normally made from cheap abundant elements, and display very large latent heats and volume changes at structural phase transitions, which make them ideal candidates to exhibit extremely large BC effects that outperform those observed in state-of-the-art BC magnetic materials, and that match applications. My unique approach combines: i) materials science to identify materials with outstanding BC performance, ii) advanced experimental techniques to explore and exploit these novel materials, iii) materials engineering to create new composite materials with enhanced BC properties, and iv) fabrication of BC devices, using insight gained from modelling of materials and device parameters.

The development of nanotechnology requires a high control on the building blocks of the structures. The concept of self-assembly has been introduced and successfully applied in recent years to build all sorts of nanostructures. However, self-assembly generally involves an attractive interaction of the elements which requires the use of specially designed nanoparticles, thus imposing severe limitations in the applicability of self-assembly. The approach I want to explore in this project is a complete change of paradigm which consists on assembling nanostructures through the collapse of evaporating drops: A droplet, containing both metallic nanoparticles and a tiny amount of analyte molecules, evaporates until the whole solvent vanishes and only the solutes are left. By manipulating the way the droplet evaporates, we can control the shape and properties of the remains, and therefore assemble metallic nanoparticles together with the molecules of interest in a passive way. The project will increase the reach of plasmonic-based techniques for the early detection of diseases: First, the approach does not rely on expensive fabrication techniques, but only on the thermodynamics and the statistical physics of the particle packings. Secondly, by using a physical approach to form nanoparticle and analyte aggregates, we avoid adverse interactions with the analyte’s chemistry.

This enhances the light emission rate by an order of magnitude and provides a substantial increase in the efficiency as well as several other technical and fundamental benefits. The main goal of iTPX is to demonstrate high power EL cooling for the first time and to provide quantitative insight on the limitations and possibilities of the cavity-based approach. Recent studies have shown extremely high – over 99 % – internal and external quantum efficiencies of light emission from optically pumped semiconductor structures. This suggests that the material quality of common III-V compound semiconductors is perfectly sufficient for EL cooling if similarly performing electrically injected structures can be fabricated in the single cavity configuration.","Oksanen Jani Erkki",2014,1981250,"Aalto University","excluded",NA
"ref_157","ANISOGEL","Injectable anisotropic microgel-in-hydrogel matrices for spinal cord repair","This project will engineer an injectable biomaterial that forms an anisotropic microheterogeneous structure in vivo. Injectable hydrogels enable a minimal invasive in situ generation of matrices for the regeneration of tissues and organs, but currently lack structural organization and unidirectional orientation. The anisotropic, injectable hydrogels to be developed will mimic local extracellular matrix architectures that cells encounter in complex tissues (e.g. nerves, muscles). This project aims for the development of a biomimetic scaffold for spinal cord regeneration. To realize such a major breakthrough, my group will focus on three research objectives. i) Poly(ethylene glycol) microgel-in-hydrogel matrices will be fabricated with the ability to create macroscopic order due to microgel shape anisotropy and magnetic alignment. Barrel-like microgels will be prepared using an in-mold polymerization technique. Their ability to self-assemble will be investigated in function of their dimensions, aspect ratio, crosslinking density, and volume fraction. Superparamagnetic nanoparticles will be included into the microgels to enable unidirectional orientation by means of a magnetic field. Subsequently, the oriented microgels will be interlocked within a master hydrogel. ii) The microgel-in-hydrogel matrices will be equipped with (bio)functional properties for spinal cord regeneration, i.e., to control and optimize mechanical anisotropy and biological signaling by in vitro cell growth experiments. iii) Selected hydrogel composites will be injected after rat spinal cord injury and directional tissue growth and animal functional behavior will be analyzed. Succesful fabrication of the proposed microgel-in-hydrogel matrix will provide a new type of biomaterial, which enables investigating the effect of an anisotropic structure on physiological and pathological processes in vivo. This is a decisive step towards creating a clinical healing matrix for anisotropic tissue repair.","De Laporte Laura",2014,1435396,"DWI – Leibniz Institute for Interactive Materials","excluded",NA
"ref_158","ExtreFlow","Extreme deformation of structured fluids and interfaces. Exploiting ultrafast collapse and yielding phenomena for new processes and formulated products","The increasing demand for environmentally friendly, healthier, and better performing formulated products means that the process industry needs more than ever predictive models of formulation performance for rapid, effective, and sustainable screening of new products. Processing flows and end use produce deformations that are extreme compared to what is accessible with existing experimental methods. As a consequence, the effects of extreme deformation are often overlooked without justification. Extreme deformation of structured fluids and soft materials is an unexplored dynamic regime where unexpected phenomena may emerge. New flow-induced microstructures can arise due to periodic forcing that is much faster than the relaxation timescale of the system, leading to collective behaviors and large transient stresses. The goal of this research is to introduce a radically innovative approach to explore and characterize the regime of extreme deformation of structured fluids and interfaces. By combining cutting-edge techniques including acoustofluidics, microfluidics, and high-speed imaging, I will perform pioneering high-precision measurements of macroscopic stresses and evolution of the microstructure. I will also explore strategies to exploit the phenomena emerging upon extreme deformation (collapse under ultrafast compression, yielding) for new processes and for adding new functionality to formulated products. These experimental results, complemented by discrete particle simulations and continuum-scale modeling, will provide new insights that will lay the foundations of the new field of ultrafast soft matter. Ultimately the results of this research program will guide the development of predictive tools that can tackle the time scales of realistic flow conditions for applications to virtual screening of new formulations.","Garbin Valeria",2014,1499186,"Delft University of Technology","selected",NA
"ref_159","AEROFLEX","AEROelastic instabilities and control of FLEXible Structures","Aeroelastic instabilities are at the origin of large deformations of structures and are limiting the capacities of products in various industrial branches such as aeronautics, marine industry, or wind electricity production. If suppressing aeroelastic instabilities is an ultimate goal, a paradigm shift in the technological development is to take advantage of these instabilities to achieve others objectives, as reducing the drag of these flexible structures. The ground-breaking challenges addressed in this project are to design fundamentally new theoretical methodologies for (i) describing mathematically aeroelastic instabilities, (ii) suppressing them and (iii) using them to reduce mean drag of structures at a low energetic cost. To that aim, two types of aeroelastic phenomena will be specifically studied: the flutter, which arises as a result of an unstable coupling instability between two stable dynamics, that of the structures and that the flow, and vortex-induced vibrations which appear when the fluid dynamics is unstable. An aeroelastic global stability analysis will be first developed and applied to problems of increasing complexity, starting from two-dimensional free-vibrating rigid structures and progressing towards three-dimensional free-deforming elastic structures. The control of these aeroelastic instabilities will be then addressed with two different objectives: their suppression or their use for flow control. A theoretical passive control methodology will be established for suppressing linear aeroelastic instabilities, and extended to high Reynolds number flows and experimental configurations. New perturbation methods for solving strongly nonlinear problems and adjoint-based control algorithm will allow to use these aeroelastic instabilities for drag reduction. This project will allow innovative control solutions to emerge, not only in flutter or vortex-induced vibrations problems, but also in a much broader class of fluid-structure problems.","MARQUET Olivier Pierre",2014,1377290,"French Aerospace Lab (ONERA)","excluded",NA
"ref_160","Spray-Imaging","Detailed Characterization of Spray Systems using Novel Laser Imaging Techniques","The multiple scattering of light is a complex phenomenon, commonly encountered but rarely desired. In imaging it induces strong blurring on the recorded photographs, limiting the range of applicability and accuracy of modern optical instruments. A typical example concerns the laser diagnostics of spray systems. The PI has revealed in 2008 a technique based on structured illumination with the important capability to remove the contributions from multiple light scattering, allowing the unique possibility of visualising through dense sprays. Based on this acquired knowledge, the aim of this proposal is to develop and apply three novel imaging techniques for the complete characterizations of spray systems: The first technique will focus on visualizing with both high contrast and high resolution various spray phenomena that have not been observed in the past. such as complex spray breakup mechanisms in the near-nozzle region. The second technique is related to the characterization of the formed droplets field. This concerns the accurate measurement of both droplets size and concentration using a three-dimensional imaging approach. Finally, a third important task is the mapping of the spray temperature over the whole spray system. This information would lead to the determination of heat transfer and evaporation rate, which are key factors in the performance of combustion devices. By extracting these important quantities - dynamics, droplets size/concentration and thermometry - fundamental insights which are still missing to fully understand the process of atomization will be provided. This will also serve at validating modern CFD models, leading to reliable predictions of spray behaviours. Even though this work can directly benefit to a large number of medical and industrial spray applications, it will mostly focus on fuel spray injections used in combustion devices.","Berrocal Edouard Jean Jacques",2014,1500000,"Lund University","excluded",NA
"ref_161","CELL HYBRIDGE","3D Scaffolds as a Stem Cell Delivery System for Musculoskeletal Regenerative Medicine","Aging worldwide population demands new solutions to permanently restore damaged tissues, thus reducing healthcare costs. Regenerative medicine offers alternative therapies for tissue repair. Although first clinical trials revealed excellent initial response after implantation of these engineered tissues, long-term follow-ups demonstrated that degeneration and lack of integration with the surrounding tissues occur. Causes are related to insufficient cell-material interactions and loss of cell potency when cultured in two-dimensional substrates, among others. Stem cells are a promising alternative due to their differentiation potential into multiple lineages. Yet, better control over cell-material interactions is necessary to maintain tissue engineered constructs in time. It is crucial to control stem cell quiescence, proliferation and differentiation in three-dimensional scaffolds while maintaining cells viable in situ. Stem cell activity is controlled by a complex cascade of signals called “niche”, where the extra-cellular matrix (ECM) surrounding the cells play a major role. Designing scaffolds inspired by this cellular niche and its ECM may lead to engineered tissues with instructive properties characterized by enhanced homeostasis, stability and integration with the surrounding milieu. This research proposal aims at engineering constructs where scaffolds work as stem cell delivery systems actively controlling cell quiescence, proliferation, and differentiation. This challenge will be approached through a biomimetic design inspired by the mesenchymal stem cell niche. Three different scaffolds will be combined to achieve this purpose: (i) a scaffold designed to maintain cell quiescence. (ii) a scaffold designed to promote cell proliferation. and (iii) a scaffold designed to control cell differentiation. To prove the design criteria the evaluation of stem cell quiescence, proliferation, and differentiation will be assessed for musculoskeletal regenerative therapies.","Moroni Lorenzo",2014,1500000,"Maastricht University","excluded",NA
"ref_162","MAGNETO","Active Magnetorheological Elastomers: from Hierarchical Composite Materials to tailored Instabilities","In recent years, there has been an increased effort by scientists to obtain new composite materials with extreme properties. Inspired by natural and biological processes, scientists have proposed the use of hierarchical architectures (i.e., assembly of structural components) spanning several length scales from nanometer to centimeter sizes. Depending each time on the desired properties of the composite material, optimization with respect to its stiffness, weight, density, toughness and other properties is carried out. In the present subject, the interest is in magneto-mechanical coupling and tailored instabilities. Hierarchical materials, such as magnetorheological elastomers (MREs) which combine magnetic particles (at the scale of nanometers and micrometers) embedded in a soft polymeric non-magnetic matrix, give rise to a coupled magneto-mechanical response at the macroscopic (order of millimeters and centimeters) scale when they are subjected to combined magneto-mechanical external stimuli. These composite materials can deform at very large strains due to the presence of the soft polymeric matrix without fracturing. From an unconventional point of view, a remarkable property of these materials is that while they can become unstable by combined magneto-mechanical loading, their response is well controlled in the post-instability regime. This, in turn, allows us to try to operate these materials in this critically stable region, similar to most biological systems. These instabilities can lead to extreme responses such as wrinkles (for haptic applications), actively controlled stiffness (for cell-growth) and acoustic properties with only marginal changes in the externally applied magnetic fields. Unlike the current modeling of hierarchical composites, MREs require the development of novel experimental techniques and advanced coupled nonlinear magneto-mechanical models in order to tailor the desired macroscopic instability response at finite strains.","Danas Konstantinos",2014,1499206,"National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS)","excluded",NA

This project aims to address two major challenges: to achieve the realization of a highly mechanically stable implant, allowing long term connection between neurons and microelectrodes and to provide neural implants with a high temporal and spatial resolution. To do so, the present project will develop implants with structural and mechanical properties that resemble those of the natural brain environment. According to the literature, using electrodes and electric leads with a size of a few microns allows for a better neural tissue reconstruction around the implant. Also, the mechanical mismatch between the usually stiff implant material and the soft brain tissue affects the adhesion between tissue cells and electrodes. With the objective to implant a highly flexible free-floating microelectrode array in the brain tissue, we will develop a new method using micro-nanotechnology steps as well as a combination of polymers. Moreover, the literature and preliminary studies indicate that some surface chemistries and nanotopographies can promote neurite outgrowth while limiting glial cell proliferation. Implants will be nanostructured so as to help the neural tissue growth and to be provided with a highly adhesive property, which will ensure its stable contact with the brain neural tissue over time. Implants with different microelectrode configurations and number will be tested in vitro and in vivo for their biocompatibility and their ability to record and stimulate neurons with high stability. This project will produce high-performance generic implants that can be used for various fundamental studies and applications, including neural prostheses and brain machine interfaces.","Offranc piret Gaelle",2014,1499850,"National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM)","excluded",NA

While the vision of the proposal is a very ambitious one, my ground-breaking research work to date related with oxide based transistors on paper (from which I am one of the co-inventors) has contributed to the basic technological breakthroughs needed to create the key elements to establish a new era of paper electronics. Field effect transistors (FETs), memory and CMOS devices, with excellent electronic performance and using paper as substrate and dielectric have resulted from my recent work.

Therefore during mixing the lifetime of micro(µ)-scale(s) inhomogeneities exceeds that one of macro(m)-scale(s) inhomogeneities. Thus m-s homogeneous systems can still exhibit µ-s inhomogeneities. They affect the functioning-chain of processes, e.g. reactions and phase-transitions or –separations, which themselves also take place on a sub-macro-scale. Therefore it will be analyzed in situ how µ-s inhomogeneities influence the functioning chain of the particle generation (supercritical antisolvent technology), the reaction (high pressure combustion), and the phase-separation or phase-transition mechanisms (surfactant-free CO2-based micro-emulsions and gas hydrates) and to which extend these inhomogeneities are responsible for the characteristics of the product, such as unfavourable size distributions of particulate products and/or pollutant emissions. On this purpose the here proposed and self-developed non-invasive and in situ Raman spectroscopic technique considers the INTENSITY-ratios of Raman signals to analyze the m-s composition and the SIGNATURE of the OH stretch vibration Raman signal of water (or alcohols) to analyze the µ-s composition of fluid mixtures. The SIGNATURE of the OH stretch vibration Raman signal is influenced by the development of the hydrogen bonds -an intermolecular interaction- and thus provides the µ-s composition, though the probe volume of the Raman sensor is m-s. The signal-INTENSITY-ratio and signal-SIGNATURE are extracted both from one and the same “m-s” Raman spectrum of the mixture. This allows the comparison of the degree of mixing on m-s and µ-s simultaneously, and enables the analysis of whether a system at any instance of mixing (instance of the onset of a reaction or a phase transition or –separation) has reached the favourable µ-s homogeneity, which would result in homogeneous and uniform products.","Braeuer Andreas",2014,1943750,"TU Bergakademie Freiberg","excluded",NA

In many cases corneal transplants can restore vision however the shortage of donor corneas suitable for transplantation has necessitated the development of alternative treatments. The aim of this project is to develop a new approach to corneal tissue regeneration. Previous approaches at engineering corneal tissue have required access to donor cells and lengthy culture periods in an attempt to grow tissue in vitro prior to implantation with only limited success and at great expense. Our approach will differ fundamentally from these in that we will design artificial corneal scaffolds that do not require donated cells or in vitro culture but instead will recruit the patient’s own cells to regenerate the cornea post-implantation. These biomaterial scaffolds will incorporate specific chemical and physical cues with the deliberate aim of attracting cells and inducing tissue formation. Studies will be undertaken to examine how different chemical, biochemical, physical and mechanical cues can be used to control the behaviour of corneal epithelial, stromal and endothelial cells. Once the optimal combination of these cues has been determined, this information will be incorporated into the design of the scaffold. Recent advances in manufacturing and material processing technology will enable us to develop scaffolds with organized nanometric architectures and that incorporate controlled growth factor release mechanisms. Techniques such as 3D bio-printing and nanofiber electrospinning will be used to fabricate scaffolds. The ability of the scaffold to attract cells and promote matrix remodelling will be examined by developing an in vitro bioreactor system capable of mimicking the ocular environment and by performing in vivo tests using a live animal model.","Ahearne Mark Joseph",2014,1498734,"Trinity College","excluded",NA

Arteries may be regarded as fibre-reinforced materials, with the stiffer collagen fibres present in the arterial wall bearing most of the load during pressurisation. Degenerative vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and aneurysms alter the macroscopic mechanical properties of arterial tissue and therefore change the arterial wall composition and the quality and orientation of the underlying fibrous architecture. Information on the complex fibre architecture of arterial tissues is therefore at the core of understanding the aetiology of vascular diseases. The current proposal aims to use a combination of in vivo Diffusion Tensor Magnetic Resonance Imaging, with parallel in silico modelling, to non-invasively identify differences in the fibre architecture of human carotid arteries which can be directly linked with carotid artery disease and hence used to diagnose vulnerable plaque rupture risk. Knowledge of arterial fibre patterns, and how these fibres alter in response to their mechanical environment, also provides a means of understanding remodelling of tissue engineered vessels. Therefore, in the second phase of this project, this novel imaging framework will be used to determine fibre patterns of decellularised arterial constructs in vitro with a view to directing mesenchymal stem cell growth and differentiation and creating a biologically and mechanically compatible tissue engineered vessel. In silico mechanobiological models will also be used to help identify the optimum loading environment for the vessels to encourage cell repopulation but prevent excessive intimal hyperplasia.

(1) Diffuse solar radiation will be captured to produce higher efficiencies with concentration ratios over 3 in plasmonically enhanced luminescent solar concentrators (PLSC). Current LSC efficiency achieved is 7.1%, [1]. This proposal will boost efficiency utilising metal nanoparticles (MNP) tuned to luminescent material type in LSCs, to induce plasmonic enhancement of emission (PI and team have achieved 53% emission enhancement). MNP will be aligned to enable directional emission within the LSC (being patented by PI and team).

Nanoscale piezoelectric energy harvesters, also known as nanogenerators (NGs), can directly convert small scale ambient vibrations into electrical energy. Scavenging power from ubiquitous vibrations in this way offers an attractive route to supersede fixed power sources such as batteries that need replacing/recharging, and that do not scale with the diminishing size of modern electronics. This proposal aims to develop NGs for future self-powered smart devices. Ceramics such as lead zirconium titanate and semiconductors such as zinc oxide are the most widely used piezoelectric EH materials. This proposal however focuses on a different class of piezoelectric materials, namely ferroelectric polymers, such as polyvinlyidene fluoride (PVDF), its copolymers, and nylon. These are potentially superior EH materials as they are flexible, robust, lightweight, easy and cheap to fabricate, as well as being lead-free and bio-compatible. The key strategy of this proposal is in combining i) materials engineering to create novel piezoelectric polymer-ceramic nanocomposite materials with enhanced EH functionalities, ii) state-of-the art nanoscale characterization to explore and exploit these novel materials, and iii) fabrication of high performance NGs for implementation into commercial devices, using insight gained from modelling of materials and device parameters.

The complex patterns such instabilities make, and the great speed with which they develop, have led to a host of technological and scientific applications. However, recent experiments have revealed significant gaps in our theoretical understanding of such instabilities, particularly in the roles played by geometry and dynamics. I will establish a group to develop and validate a theoretical framework within which these results can be understood. Central to my approach is an appreciation of the crucial role of geometry in the pattern formation and dynamics of elastic instabilities. As a starting point, I will consider the model problem of a pressurized elastic shell subject to a geometrically large deformation. This system develops either wrinkles or a stress-focusing instability depending on the internal pressure. As such, this is a natural paradigm with which to understand geometrical features of deformation relevant across length scales from deformed viruses to the subduction zones in Earth’s tectonic plates. My team will combine theoretical and computational approaches with tabletop experiments to determine a new set of shell deformations that are generically observed in contradiction of the classic ‘mirror buckling’. Understanding why these new shapes emerge will transform our perception of shell instabilities and provide new fundamental building blocks with which to model them. These ideas will also be used to transform our understanding of a number of other, previously mysterious, elastic instabilities of practical interest. Turning our focus to the dynamics of instabilities such as the snap-through of shells, we will show that accounting for geometry is again crucial.

Yet, while selected experiments point towards this scientifically fascinating and technologically important possibility (e.g., for advances in structural and functional materials), further progress crucially relies on insight from theoretical simulations. The most successful simulation tool is molecular dynamics. Recent advances in hardware allow to tackle trillions of atoms making a comparison with nano-experiments almost possible. The nagging problem is, however, a huge time-scale gap of up to ten orders of magnitude and none of the presently available approaches is able to cope with this discrepancy. TIME-BRIDGE aims at solving the time-scale problem by borrowing a concept well known and developed in the field of first-principles simulations: the pseudopotential ansatz. In first principles simulations a similar time scale gap exists between slow and fast moving electrons. The solution is to capture the effect of the fast electrons only effectively within a pseudopotential while retaining the motion of slow electrons important for chemical bonding. An equivalent pseudopotential ansatz is envisioned to be applicable to the fast thermal motion of atoms, the origin of the time scale problem. Capturing the thermal motion in an effective potential will allow to simulate the relevant mechanical processes occurring on microsecond and second time scales. In TIME-BRIDGE high risk and high gains apply: the physics of electrons is distinct from the atomic motion possibly making the pseudopotential ansatz non-transferable, but—based on PI’s distinguished expertise and his recent methodological advancements—a route to bridge the fundamental time scale gap might arise.","Grabowski Blazej Tadeusz",2014,1499375,"University of Stuttgart","excluded",NA
"ref_174","HyMoCo","Hybrid Node Modes for Highly Efficient Light Concentrators","The meaning of solar energy for future decentralized power supply will largely depend on both efficiency and cost of solar to electrical power conversion. All kinds of conversion strategies including photovoltaics, concentrated solar power, solar to fuel and others would benefit from efficiently collecting solar power on large areas. For this reason luminescent solar concentrators have been developed for over thirty years, but due to waveguide losses their maximum size is still limited to a few centimeters. The proposed project suggests the exploitation of a new type of electromagnetic waveguide in order to realize passive planar concentrators of unsurpassed collection efficiency, size, concentration, lifetime and costs. A dielectric TE1-mode shows a node, a position in the waveguide where no intensity is found. A thin film placed in this node remains largely “invisible” for the propagating mode. Such dielectric node modes (DNMs) have been investigated by the applicant in previous work, but only recently a silver island film (SIF) was for the first time placed in such a node. The resulting extremely low waveguide losses cannot be explained by our current understanding of waveguide modes and hint to a hybridization between the SIF-bound long-range surface plasmon polaritons (LRSPPs) and the DNMs into what we call hybrid node modes (HNMs). The SIFs strongly interact with incident light. An appropriate nanopatterning of SIFs enables efficient excitation of low-loss HNMs modes collecting solar power over square meters and concentrating it. To achieve this goal new technological methods are used that enable patterning on the nanometer scale and low cost roll-to-roll processing at the same time. New measurement techniques and numerical simulation tools will be developed to investigate the HNMs – a novel kind of electromagnetic modes – and their exploitation in the passive solar concentrators.","Görrn Patrick",2014,1485000,"University of Wuppertal","excluded",NA

These effects are associated with a higher prevalence of arrhythmias, which, on top of deteriorating quality of life, increase the risk of other cardiovascular diseases like stroke, heart failure and neurological sequelae. Investigations targeting cardiac aging have often focused on assessing the effects of a specific contributing factor, at a single evaluation scale (molecular, cell, tissue, organ) and in many cases using animal species not relevant to humans in terms of aging mechanisms. MODELAGE proposes a multi-scale, multi-factorial research that is expected to make an important step in the characterization of human heart aging at both the population and individual levels.

Indices describing spatio-temporal dynamics of cardiac electrophysiology will be evaluated in a population of young to senescent individuals using a novel feedback control approach. Inter-individual age-related variations in those indices will be assessed and correlated with markers of biological age (as opposed to chronological age).

The overall aim is to produce composite membranes comprising engineered Metal Organic Framework (MOF) particles and polymers in the form of Mixed Matrix Membranes (MMMs). By applying these new membranes, energetically more efficient separations will be possible. Despite the superior performance of membranes only based on crystalline materials like zeolites or MOFs, polymeric membranes rule the commercial scene thanks to their easy processing, high reproducibility and mechanical strength. However, the existing polymeric membrane materials are not optimal: improvements in permeability are always at the expense of selectivity and vice versa, while plasticization threatens their application at high pressures. This research aims at utilizing the best of both fields by combining the high selectivity of MOFs with the easy processing of polymers in the form of Mixed Matrix Membranes. The main barrier to achieve this goal is the optimization of the MOF-polymer interaction and mass transport through the composite. This is very challenging because chemical compatibility, particle morphology and filler dispersion play a key role. Innovatively the project will be the first systematic study into this multi-scale phenomenon with investigations at all relevant interactions, including MOF particle tuning targeting the application in MMMs. A thorough study on the synthesis of the selected MOF structures and on the performance of the composites will allow engineering MOFs at the molecular and particle levels, resulting in higher selectivity and faster transport.

Electroporation is the electrical disruption of biological membranes to introduce naked DNA into the cell. Due to our lack of information about fundamentals of electropores formation and DNA electrotransfer, electroporation methods still suffer from low transfection efficiency, random uptake and excessive cell damage. The main barriers to achieving this goal are: i) understanding the creation of electropores at molecular level. ii) understanding the underlying mechanism of DNA transport across the membrane of a cell during and after electric pulses and iii) controlling the electrotransfer of DNA through these pores into a cell at molecular level. It is almost impossible to overcome these barriers based on our current rudimentary understanding of cell electroporation. The successful outcome of this project will significantly aid the development of gene delivery into living cells, which will lead to electroporation-based therapies in the near future.To this end, I will apply a multidisciplinary approach, combining disciplines as physical chemistry, transport phenomena, DNA dynamics, biophysics and cell biology. To unveil the entire electroporation process, innovatively I will employ the integrated atomic force microscopy with micro/nanofluidics to visualize the evolution of pore size/density at the membrane level. Furthermore, to understand the DNA electrotransfer, I will study how DNA interacts with electropores and moves through them using optical tweezers and single-molecule FRET. Finally, I will dissect the role of cytoskeleton on the transport of DNA, by mapping out the relationship between the viscoelasticity of cell and location of DNA inside the cell.","Boukany Pouyan",2013,1481409,"Delft University of Technology","excluded",NA
"ref_178","REMOTE","Real-time monitoring of load induced remodeling in tissue-engineered bone","The maintenance of the skeleton is tightly coupled with balanced bone formation and resorption processes that are mediated by osteoblasts and osteoclasts, respectively. Loss of this balance results in skeletal pathologies representing some of the most significant public health threats faced by the growing and ageing population. Tissue engineering investigates various health aspects such as drug development, fundamental research and regenerative medicine. State-of-the-art approaches are lacking to mimic one essential functional property of bone: to adapt its 3D morphology according to imposed mechanical loads. As most drugs for skeletal diseases act on this anabolic-catabolic balance, an engineered system serving as a human in vitro model for drug discovery/testing needs to be able to mimic this process. This proposal aims at combining real-time monitoring of mineralized extracellular matrix with bone tissue engineering culture standards in advanced bioreactors and will design a reliable 3D in vitro model system to mimic load induced remodeling of tissue-engineered human bone. The following particulars will be systematically addressed: i) Establishment of a co-culture of human bone-forming cells and human bone resorbing cells capable of mimicking bone remodeling. ii) Real-time monitoring platform in 3D in order to take the temporo-spatial development of the tissue into account and to allow specific adapted and controlled interventions depending on the actual environmental situation. iii) Quantitative simulation of morphological bone adaptation induced by mechanical load. The proposed research activity will have important implications in fields ranging from pharmacology and biotechnology to biomechanics and medicine. It will result in a ground-breaking platform that could be applied to screen initial bone drug effects and will improve our fundamental understanding of structure-function relationships in normal and diseased bone conditions.","Hofmann Boss Sandra",2013,1496859,"Eindhoven University of Technology","excluded",NA

Electrospun nanofibrous matrices (so-called mats) are an exciting class of materials with a wide range of possible applications. Nevertheless, the development and functionalization of these electrospun materials remain very challenging tasks. Atmospheric pressure plasma technology will be utilized by my research group to create advanced biodegradable electrospun mats with unprecedented functionality and performance. To realise such a major breakthrough, plasma technology will be implemented in different steps of the manufacturing process: pre-electrospinning and post-electrospinning. My group will focus on four cornerstone research lines, which have been carefully chosen so that all critical issues one could encounter in creating advanced biodegradable electrospun mats are tackled. Research cornerstone A aims to develop biodegradable electrospun mats with appropriate bulk properties, while in research cornerstone B pre-electrospinning polymer solutions will be exposed to non-thermal atmospheric plasmas. This will be realized by probing unexplored concepts such as discharges created inside polymer solutions. In a third cornerstone C, an in-depth study of the interactions between an atmospheric pressure plasma and an electrospun mat will be carried out. Finally, the last cornerstone D will focus on plasma-assisted surface modification of biodegradable electrospun mats for tissue engineering purposes. Realization of these four cornerstones would result in a major breakthrough in their specific field which makes this proposal inherently a relatively high risk/very high gain proposal.

"ref_180","MechJointMorph","The role of mechanical forces induced by prenatal movements in joint morphogenesis","Most joints start off the same during embryonic development, as two opposing cartilage surfaces, and are moulded into the diverse range of shapes seen in the adult in a process known as morphogenesis. While we understand very little of the biological or mechanobiological processes driving joint morphogenesis, there is evidence to suggest that fetal movements play a critical role in joint shape development. Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH), where the hip is partly or fully dislocated, is much more common when the baby’s movement is restricted or prevented. This proposal will determine how mechanical forces influence joint shape morphogenesis, which is of key relevance to neonatal joint conditions such as DDH, to adult joint health and disease, and to tissue engineering of cartilage. A mouse line in which mutant embryos have no skeletal muscle will be studied, providing the first in depth analysis of mammalian joint shape development for normal and abnormal mechanical environments. The mouse line could provide the first mammalian model system for prenatal onset DDH. ‘Passive’ movements of these mutant embryos will then be induced by massage of the mother, and the effects on the joints measured. If the effects on joint shape of absent spontaneous movement are mitigated by the treatment, this technique could eventually be used as a preventative treatment for DDH. Next, an in vitro approach will be used to quantify how much movement is needed for joint shape development. This research will provide an optimised protocol for applying biophysical stimuli to promote cartilage growth and morphogenesis in culture, providing valuable cues to cartilage tissue engineers. Finally, a computational simulation of joint shape morphogenesis will be created, which will integrate the new understanding gained from the experimental research in order to predict how different joints shapes develop in normal and abnormal mechanical environments.","Nowlan Niamh Catherine",2013,1499501,"Imperial College","excluded",NA

Current methods for HT cell screenings, however, either require a large number of microplates, are prone to cross-contaminations and are limited to adherent cells (cell microarrays), or are not compatible with adherent cells as well as with spatial indexing (droplet microfluidics). We recently demonstrated the use of superhydrophobic-superhydrophilic microarrays to create high-density arrays of microdroplets or hydrogel micropads. We propose here to develop a new platform for HT cell screening experiments using the unique properties of the superhydrophilic microarrays separated by superhydrophobic thin barriers. The new technology will allow us to perform up to 300K cell experiments in parallel using a single chip. Individual cell experiments will be performed in thousands of completely isolated microdroplet at defined locations on the chip. This will enable spatial indexing, time-lapse measurements and screening of either adherent or non-adherent cells. Parallel manipulations within individual microreservoirs, such as washing, addition of chemical libraries, or staining will be developed to open new possibilities in the field of live cell studies. Superhydrophobic barriers will allow complete isolation of the microreservoirs, thus preventing cross-contamination and cell migration. We will also develop a technology for the HT screening of cells in 3D hydrogel micropads. We will use these methods to gain better understanding of how different parameters of the 3D cell microenvironment influence various aspects of cell behavior. The project will require the development of new technological tools which can later be applied to a wide range of cell screening experiments and biological problems. Our long term aim is to replace the outdated microplate technology with a more powerful and convenient method for cell screening experiments.","Levkin Pavel",2013,1499820,"Karlsruhe Institute of Technology","excluded",NA

Despite this fact, little is currently known about how biomaterials interact with water. This knowledge is crucial for the development and optimisation of novel functional biomaterials for human health (e.g. biosensing devices, erodible biomaterials, drug release carriers, wound dressings). BioWater will develop near and mid infrared chemical imaging (NIR-MIR-CI) techniques to investigate the fundamental interaction between biomaterials and water in order to understand the key processes of biodegradation, biocompatibility and biofouling. This ambitious yet achievable project will focus on two major categories of biomaterials relevant to human health: extracellular collagens and synthetic biopolymers. Initially, interactions between these biomaterials and water will be investigated. subsequently interactions with more complicated matrices (e.g. protein solutions and cellular systems) will be studied. CI data will be correlated with standard surface characterization, biocompatibility and biodegradation measurements. Molecular dynamic simulations will complement this work to identify the most probable molecular structures of water at different biomaterial interfaces. Advanced understanding of the role of water in biocompatibility, biofouling and biodegradation processes will facilitate the optimization of biomaterials tailored to specific cellular environments with a broad range of therapeutic applications (e.g. drug eluting stents, tissue engineering, wound healing). The new NIR-MIR-CI/chemometric methodologies developed in BioWater will allow for the rapid characterization and monitoring of novel biomaterials at pre-clinical stages, improving process control by overcoming the laborious and time consuming large-scale sampling methods currently required in biomaterials development.","Gowen Aoife Ann",2013,1487681,"National University of Ireland - University College Dublin","excluded",NA

Solution processed organic semiconductors can enable this goal as they support drastically less expensive fabrication techniques compared to traditional semiconductors. Molecular organic semiconductors (MOSs) offer many advantages to their more-common pi-conjugated polymer counterparts, however a clear and fundamental challenge to enable the goal of high performance solution-processable molecular organic semiconductor devices is to develop the ability to control the crystal packing, crystalline domain size, and mixing ability (for multicomponent blends) in the thin-film device geometry. The CEMOS project will accomplish this by pioneering innovative methods of “bottom-up” crystal engineering for organic semiconductors. We will employ specifically tailored molecules designed to leverage both thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of molecular organic semiconductor systems to direct and control crystalline packing, promote crystallite nucleation, compatibilize disparate phases, and plasticize inelastic materials. We will demonstrate that our new classes of materials can enable the tuning of the charge carrier transport and morphology in MOS thin films, and we will evaluate their performance in actual thin-film transistor (TFT) and organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. Our highly interdisciplinary approach, combining material synthesis and device fabrication/evaluation, will not only lead to improvements in the performance and stability of OPVs and TFTs but will also give deep insights into how the crystalline packing—independent from the molecular structure—affects the optoelectronic properties. The success of CEMOS will rapidly advance the performance of MOS devices by enabling reproducible and tuneable performance comparable to traditional semiconductors—but at radically lower processing costs.","Sivula Kevin",2013,1477472,"Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL)","excluded",NA

The localized generation of electrical fields at extremely small scales has the potential to revolutionize conventional methods of electrically stimulating cells. The objective of this proposal is the development of miniaturized untethered devices capable of delivering electric currents to cells for the stimulation of their vital functions. To this end, we propose the construction of micro- and nanoscale magnetoelectric structures that can be triggered using external magnetic fields. These small devices will consist of composite hybrid structures containing piezoelectric and magnetostrictive layers. By applying an oscillating magnetic field in the presence of a DC bias field, the magnetostrictive element will deform, thereby generating stress in a piezoelectric shell, which in turn will become electrically polarized. Small devices capable of wirelessly generating electric fields offer an innovative way of studying the electrical and electrochemical stimulation of cells. For example, by concentrating electric fields at specific locations in a cell, the behavior of protein membrane components such as cell adhesion molecules or transport proteins can be altered to modulate the stiction of proliferating cells or ion channel gating kinetics.","Pané Vidal Salvador",2013,1491701,"Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich)","excluded",NA

Current therapeutics target bone resorbing osteoclasts, but these are associated with severe side effects. Osteoporosis arises when mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) fail to produce sufficient numbers of bone forming osteoblasts. A key regulator of MSC behaviour is physical loading, yet the mechanisms by which MSCs sense and respond to changes in their mechanical environment are virtually unknown. Primary cilia are nearly ubiquitous ‘antennae-like’ cellular organelles that have very recently emerged as extracellular mechano/chemo-sensors and thus, are strong candidates to play a role in regulating MSC responses in bone. Therefore, the objective of this research program is to determine the role of the primary cilium and associated molecular components in the osteogenic differentiation and recruitment of human MSCs in loading-induced bone adaptation. This will be achieved through ground-breaking in vitro and in vivo techniques developed by the applicant. The knowledge generated in this proposal will represent a profound advance in our understanding of stem cell mechanobiology. In particular, the identification of the cilium and associated molecules as central to stem cell behaviour will lead to the direct manipulation of MSCs via novel cilia-targeted therapeutics that mimic the regenerative influence of loading at a molecular level. These novel therapeutics would therefore target bone formation, providing an alternative path to treatment, resulting in an improved supply of bone forming cells, preventing osteoporosis. Furthermore, these novel therapeutics will be incorporated into biomaterials, generating bioactive osteoinductive scaffolds. These advances will not only improve quality of life for the patient but will significantly reduce the financial burden of bone loss diseases in the EU.","Hoey David",2013,1455068,"Trinity College","excluded",NA

Urban Waves will fill the gap in the engineering design and assessment of buildings in coastal areas subjected to onshore flow from tsunami preceded (or not) by earthquake ground shaking. In Aim 1 the unique experimental capability developed by the PI to reproduce flows on shorelines from tsunami will be used to provide information for fundamental research into tsunami flows onshore as well as the forces and pressures they exert on model buildings and coastal protection structures.

In Aim 3, the FE models built will be used to generate fragility functions for buildings that can be used for the assessment of risk to urban areas. The first analytical tsunami fragility functions to be derived, these will also account for the effect of preceding earthquake ground shaking.

Despite the most focused mammal antibodies, antibodies obtained from egg yolk of immunized hens, immunoglobulin Y (IgY), are an alternative option that can be obtained in higher titres by non-stressful and non-invasive methods. This large amount of available antibodies opens the door for a new kind of cheaper biopharmaceuticals. However, the production cost of high-quality IgY for large-scale applications remains higher than other drug therapies due to the lack of an efficient purification method. The search of new purification platforms is thus a vital demand to which liquid-liquid extraction using aqueous biphasic systems (ABS) could be the answer. Besides the conventional polymer-based systems, highly viscous and with a limited polarity/affinity range, a recent type of ABS composed of ionic liquids (ILs) may be employed. ILs are usually classified as “green solvents” due to their negligible vapour pressure. Yet, the major advantage of IL-based ABS relies on the possibility of tailoring their phases’ polarities aiming at extracting a target biomolecule. A proper manipulation of the system constituents and respective composition allows the pre-concentration, complete extraction, or purification of the most diverse biomolecules. This research project addresses the development of a new technique for the extraction and purification of IgY from egg yolk using IL-based ABS. The proposed plan contemplates the optimization of purification systems at the laboratory scale and their use in countercurrent chromatography to achieve a simple, cost-effective and scalable process. The success of this project and its scalability to an industrial level certainly will allow the production of cheaper antibodies with a long-term impact in human healthcare.","Freire Martins Mara Guadalupe",2013,1386020,"University of Aveiro","excluded",NA

Further, they offer high currents carrying capacities of 10^9 A/cm², and thermal conductivities up to 3500 W/mK, exceeding diamond.

Nonetheless, failure of chemotherapies for many cancers (e.g. breast and pancreatic cancers and various sarcomas) is primarily because these agents cannot reach cancer cells in amounts sufficient to cause complete cure. The abnormal microenvironment of these tumors drastically reduces perfusion and results in insufficient delivery of therapeutic agents. Tumor structural abnormalities is in large part an effect of mechanical stresses developed within the tumor due to unchecked cancer cell proliferation that strains the tumor microenvironment. Alleviation of these stresses has the potential to normalize the tumor, enhance delivery of drugs and improve treatment efficacy.

To explore this hypothesis, I will make use of a mixture of cutting-edge computational and experimental techniques. I will develop sophisticated models for the biomechanical response of tumors to analyze how stresses are generated and transmitted during tumor progression. Subsequently, I will perform animal studies to validate model predictions and indentify the drug that more effectively alleviates stress levels, normalizes the tumor microenvironment and improves chemotherapy.

The recently developed capillary suspensions concept has the potential to revolutionize product formulations and material design. When a small amount (less than 1%) of a second immiscible liquid is added to the continuous phase of a suspension, the rheological properties of the mixture are dramatically altered from a fluid-like to a gel-like state or from a weak to a strong gel and the strength can be tuned in a wide range covering orders of magnitude.

Latest investigations show that nanostructured steels formed by non-equilibrium phases increasing strength, such as martensite and bainite, and enhancing strain hardening, such as austenite, fulfil these demands with outstanding performance. In the last few years, I have observed that non-equilibrium phases strongly affect each other’s formation and stability, with effects on the kinetics of the microstructure development. Thus, I theoretically and experimentally proved that carbon enrichment of austenite, essential for its stability at room temperature, occurs at a high rate via diffusion from martensite. Moreover, I showed that martensite triggers bainite formation, which significantly increases bainite kinetics. I believe that these interactions between non-equilibrium phases constitute a revolutionary tool for the development of nanostructured steels in the future. This project addresses a new concept to create novel nanostructured steels in which the microstructure development is controlled by interactions between non-equilibrium phases. This innovative idea opens an unprecedented approach for the design of metallic alloys.

The basic idea of a multiphase reactor is to contact chemical precursors and catalysts in a sufficient time for the reaction to proceed, but reactor performance is crucially affected by the complex reactor hydrodynamics. A proper optimization would imply that multiphase flows are adequately understood. Gas bubbled into a pool of liquid is the simplest example of a multiphase reactor. Bubble columns or distillation columns, however, house millions of bubbles emerging in swarms with interactions such as coalescence and breakage events that determine the whole process behaviour.

Grain boundaries introduce additional resistance and reduce the conversion efficiency. Moreover, they are prone to microcracking, thus influencing the lifetime. At present, the existing standard qualification tests are not sufficient to provide a quantitative definition of lifetime, since all the possible failure mechanisms are not accounted for.

Mitigating its impact on the climate and human health, by reducing its associated emissions, is thus a priority. One significant challenge for gas-turbine combustion is combustion instability, which is currently inhibiting reductions in NOx emissions (these damage human health via a deterioration in air quality). Combustion instability is caused by a two-way coupling between unsteady combustion and acoustic waves - the large pressure oscillations that result can cause substantial mechanical damage. Currently, the lack of fast, accurate modelling tools for combustion instability, and the lack of reliable ways of suppressing it are severely hindering reductions in NOx emissions. This proposal aims to make step improvements in both fast, accurate modelling of combustion instability, and in developing reliable active control strategies for its suppression. It will achieve this by coupling low order combustor models (these are fast, simplified models for simulating combustion instability) with advances in analytical modelling, CFD simulation, reduced order modelling and control theory tools. In particular: * important advances in accurately incorporating the effect of entropy waves (temperature variations resulting from unsteady combustion) and non-linear flame models will be made. * new active control strategies for achieving reliable suppression of combustion instability, including from within limit cycle oscillations, will be developed. * an open-source low order combustor modelling tool will be developed and widely disseminated, opening access to researchers worldwide and improving communications between the fields of thermoacoustics and control theory. Thus the proposal aims to use analytical and computational methods to contribute to achieving low NOx gas-turbine combustion, without the penalty of damaging combustion instability.","Morgans Aimee",2012,1489309,"Imperial College","excluded",NA

Embryonic CV systems dynamically regulate structure and function over very short time periods throughout morphogenesis and that biomechanical loading conditions within the heart and great-vessels alter morphogenesis and gene expression. This proposal has structured around a common goal of developing a comprehensive and predictive understanding of the biomechanics and regulation of great-vessel development and its plasticity in response to clinically relevant epigenetic changes in loading conditions. Biomechanical regulation of vascular morphogenesis, including potential aortic arch (AA) reversibility or plasticity after epigenetic events relevant to human CHD are investigated using multimodal experiments in the chick embryo that investigate normal AA growth and remodeling, microsurgical instrumentation that alter ventricular and vascular blood flow loading during critical periods in AA morphogenesis.

This proposal develops and validates the first in vivo morphomechanics-integrated three-dimensional mathematical models of AA growth and remodeling that can predict normal growth patterns and abnormal vascular adaptations common in CHD.

Research efforts have been focused mainly on three areas: pathogenesis of vascular disease, development of medical devices, and virtual surgical planning. However, despite great initial promise, the actual use of patient-specific computer modelling in the clinic has been very limited. Clinical diagnosis still relies entirely on traditional methods based on imaging and invasive measurements and sampling. The same invasive trial-and-error paradigm is often seen in vascular disease research, where animal models are used profusely to quantify simple metrics that could perhaps be evaluated via non-invasive computer modelling techniques. Lastly, medical device manufacturers rely mostly on in-vitro models to investigate the anatomic variations, arterial deformations, and biomechanical forces needed for the design of stents and stent-grafts. In this project, I aim to develop an integrated image-based computer modelling framework for subject-specific cardiovascular simulation with dynamically adapting boundary conditions capable of representing alterations in the physiologic state of the patient. This computer framework will be directly applied in clinical settings to complement and enhance current diagnostic practices, working towards the goal of personalized cardiovascular medicine.","Figueroa Alvarez Carlos Alberto",2012,1491592,"King's College London","excluded",NA

Compact lasers can generate pulses with ultra-high peak powers in the Tera-Watt or even Peta-Watt ranges. These high-power pulses lead to a radically different laser-matter interaction than the one obtained with conventional lasers. Non-linear multi-photons processes are observed. they open new and exciting opportunities to tailor the matter in its intimate structure with sub-wavelength spatial resolutions and in the three dimensions. This project is aiming at exploring the use of these ultrafast lasers to locally tailor the physical properties of glass materials. More specifically, our objective is to create polymorphs embedded in bulk structures and to demonstrate their use as means to introduce new functionalities in the material. The long-term objective is to develop the scientific understanding and technological know-how to create three-dimensional objects with nanoscale features where optics, fluidics and micromechanical elements as well as active functions are integrated in a single monolithic piece of glass and to do so using a single process.

"ref_202","NOVIB","The Nonlinear Tuned Vibration Absorber","Even after more than one century of flight, both civil and military aircraft are still plagued by major vibration problems. A well-known example is the external-store induced flutter of the F-16 fighter aircraft. Such dynamical phenomena, commonly known as aeroelastic instabilities, result from the transfer of energy from the free stream to the structure and can lead to limit cycle oscillations, a phenomenon with no linear counterpart. Since nonlinear dynamical systems theory is not yet mature, the inherently nonlinear nature of these oscillations renders their mitigation a particularly difficult problem. The only practical solution to date is to limit aircraft flight envelope to regions where these instabilities are not expected to occur, as verified by intensive and expensive flight campaigns. This limitation results in a severe decrease in both aircraft efficiency and performance. At the heart of this project is a fundamental change in paradigm: although nonlinearity is usually seen as an enemy, I propose to control - and even suppress - aeroelastic instability through the intentional use of nonlinearity. This approach has the potential to bring about a major change in aircraft design and will be achieved thanks to the development of the nonlinear tuned vibration absorber, a new, rigorous nonlinear counterpart of the linear tuned vibration absorber. This work represents a number of significant challenges, because the novel functionalities brought by the intentional use of nonlinearity can be accompanied by adverse nonlinear dynamical effects. The successful mitigation of these unwanted nonlinear effects will be a major objective of our proposed research. it will require achieving both theoretical and technical advances to make it possible. A specific effort will be made to demonstrate experimentally the theoretical findings of this research with extensive wind tunnel testing and practical implementation of the nonlinear tuned vibration absorber. Finally, nonlinear instabilities such as limit cycle oscillations can be found in a number of non-aircraft applications including in bridges, automotive disc brakes and machine tools. The nonlinear tuned vibration absorber could also find uses in resolving problems in these applications, thus ensuring the generic character of the project.","Kerschen Gaetan",2012,1316440,"UNIVERSITE DE LIEGE","excluded",NA
"ref_203","MuSIC","Modeling and Simulation of Cancer Growth","Nowadays, the treatment of cancer is based on the so-called diagnostic paradigm. We feel that the shift from the traditional diagnostic paradigm to a predictive patient-specific one may lead to more effective therapies. Thus, the objective of this project is to introduce predictive models for cancer growth. These predictive models will take the form of mathematical models developed from first principles and the fundamental features of cancer biology. For these models to be useful in clinical practice, we will need to introduce new numerical algorithms that permit to obtain fast and accurate simulations based on patient-specific data. We propose to develop mathematical models using the framework provided by the mixtures theory and the phase-field method. Our model will account for the growth of the tumor and the vasculature that develops around it, which is essential for the tumor to grow beyond a harmless limited size. We propose to develop new algorithms based on Isogeometric Analysis, which is a recent generalization of Finite Elements with several advantages. The use of Isogeometric Analysis will simplify the interface between medical images and the computational mesh, permitting to generate smooth basis functions necessary to approximate higher-order partial differential equations like those that govern cancer growth. Our modeling and simulation tools will be examined and validated by experimental and clinical observations. To accomplish this, we propose to use anonymized patient-specific data through several patient imaging modalities. Arguably, the successful undertaking of this project, would have the potential to transform classical population/statistics-based treatments of cancer into patient-specific therapies. This would elevate mathematical modeling and simulation of cancer growth to a stage in which it can be used as a quantitatively accurate predictive tool with implications for clinical practice, clinical trial design, and outcome prediction.","Gómez Díaz Hector",2012,1405420,"University of A Coruna","excluded",NA
"ref_204","BackToBack","Engineering Solutions for Back Pain: Simulation of Patient Variance","Back pain affects eight out of ten adults during their lifetime. It a huge economic burden on society, estimated to cost as much as 1-2% of gross national product in several European countries. Treatments for back pain have lower levels of success and are not as technologically mature as those for other musculoskeletal disorders such as hip and knee replacement. This application proposes to tackle one of the major barriers to the development of better surgical treatments for back pain. At present, new spinal devices are commonly assessed in isolation in the laboratory under standardised conditions that do not represent the variation across the patient population. Consequently many interventions have failed during clinical trials or have proved to have poor long term success rates. Using a combination of computational and experimental models, a new testing methodology will be developed that will enable the variation between patients to be simulated for the first time. This will enable spinal implants and therapies to be more robustly evaluated across a virtual patient population prior to clinical trial. The tools developed will be used in collaboration with clinicians and basic scientists to develop and, crucially, optimise new treatments that reduce back pain whilst preserving the unique functions of the spine. If successful, this approach could be translated to evaluate and optimise emerging minimally invasive treatments in other joints such as the hip and knee. Research in the spine could then, for the first time, lead rather than follow that undertaken in other branches of orthopaedics.","Wilcox Ruth",2012,1498777,"University of Leeds","excluded",NA

In the past, engineering of wind farms focused on a bottom-up approach, in which atmospheric wind availability was considered to be fixed by climate and weather. However, farms of gigawatt size slow down the Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) as a whole, reducing the availability of wind at turbine hub height. In Denmark’s large off-shore farms, this leads to underperformance of turbines which can reach levels of 40%–50% compared to the same turbine in a lone-standing case. For large wind farms, the vertical structure and turbulence physics of the flow in the ABL become crucial ingredients in their design and operation. This introduces a new set of scientific challenges related to the design and control of large wind farms. The major ambition of the present research proposal is to employ optimal control techniques to control the interaction between large wind farms and the ABL, and optimize overall farm-power extraction. Individual turbines are used as flow actuators by dynamically pitching their blades using time scales ranging between 10 to 500 seconds. The application of such control efforts on the atmospheric boundary layer has never been attempted before, and introduces flow control on a physical scale which is currently unprecedented. The PI possesses a unique combination of expertise and tools enabling these developments: efficient parallel large-eddy simulations of wind farms, multi-scale turbine modeling, and gradient-based optimization in large optimization-parameter spaces using adjoint formulations. To ensure a maximum impact on the wind-engineering field, the project aims at optimal control, experimental wind-tunnel validation, and at including multi-disciplinary aspects, related to structural mechanics, power quality, and controller design.","Meyers Johan",2012,1499241,"University of Leuven","selected",NA

The control of angiogenesis is of utmost importance for tissue regenerative therapies as well as cancer treatment, however this remains a challenge. The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a one of the key controlling factors of angiogenesis. The mechanisms through which the ECM exerts its influence are poorly understood. MAtrix will create unprecedented opportunities for unraveling the role of the ECM in angiogenesis. It will do so by creating a highly innovative, multiscale in silico model that provides quantitative, subcellular resolution on cell-matrix interaction, which is key to the understanding of cell migration. In this way, MAtrix goes substantially beyond the state of the art in terms of computational models of angiogenesis. It will integrate mechanisms of ECM-mediated cell migration and relate them to intracellular regulatory mechanisms of angiogenesis. Apart from its innovation in terms of computational modelling, MAtrix’ impact is related to its interdisciplinarity, involving computer simulations and in vitro experiments. This will enable to investigate research hypotheses on the role of the ECM in angiogenesis that are generated by the in silico model. State of the art technologies (fluorescence microscopy, cell and ECM mechanics, biomaterials design) will be applied –in conjunction with the in silico model- to quantity cell-ECM mechanical interaction at a subcellular level and the dynamics of cell migration. In vitro experiments will be performed for a broad range of biomaterials and their characteristics. In this way, MAtrix will deliver a proof-of-concept that an in silico model can help in identifying and prioritising biomaterials characteristics, relevant for angiogenesis.

This field encompasses different scales ranging from individual monomers, cytoskeleton constituents, up to the full cell. Its focus, fueled by the development of interdisciplinary collaborative efforts between engineering, computer science and biology, until recently relatively isolated, has allowed for important breakthroughs in biomedicine, bioengineering or even neurology. However, the natural “knowledge barrier” between fields often leads to the use of one numerical tool for one bioengineering application with a limited understanding of either the tool or the field of application itself. Few groups, to date, have the knowledge and expertise to properly avoid both pits. Within the computational mechanics realm, new methods aim at bridging scale and modeling techniques ranging from density functional theory up to continuum modeling on very large scale parallel supercomputers. To the best of the knowledge of the author, a thorough and comprehensive research campaign aiming at bridging scales from proteins to the cell level while including its interaction with its surrounding media/stimulus is yet to be done. Among all cells, neurons are at the heart of tremendous medical challenges (TBI, Alzheimer, etc.). In nearly all of these challenges, the intrinsic coupling between mechanical and chemical mechanisms in neuron is of drastic relevance. I thus propose here the development of a neuron model constituted of length-scale dedicated numerical techniques, adequately bridged together. As an illustration of its usability, the model will be used for two specific applications: neurite growth and electrical-chemical-mechanical coupling in neurons. This multiscale computational framework will ultimately be made available to the bio- medical community to enhance their knowledge on neuron deformation, growth, electrosignaling and thus, Alzheimer’s disease, cancer or TBI.","Jerusalem Antoine Guy Bernard",2012,1128960,"University of Oxford","excluded",NA
"ref_209","ELASTIC-TURBULENCE","Purely-elastic flow instabilities and transition to elastic turbulence in microscale flows of complex fluids","Flows of complex fluids, such as many biological fluids and most synthetic fluids, are common in our daily life and are very important from an industrial perspective. Because of their inherent nonlinearity, the flow of complex viscoelastic fluids often leads to counterintuitive and complex behaviour and, above critical conditions, can prompt flow instabilities even under low Reynolds number conditions which are entirely absent in the corresponding Newtonian fluid flows. The primary goal of this project is to substantially expand the frontiers of our current knowledge regarding the mechanisms that lead to the development of such purely-elastic flow instabilities, and ultimately to understand the transition to so-called “elastic turbulence”, a turbulent-like phenomenon which can arise even under inertialess flow conditions. This is an extremely challenging problem, and to significantly advance our knowledge in such important flows these instabilities will be investigated in a combined manner encompassing experiments, theory and numerical simulations. Such a holistic approach will enable us to understand the underlying mechanisms of those instabilities and to develop accurate criteria for their prediction far in advance of what we could achieve with either approach separately. A deep understanding of the mechanisms generating elastic instabilities and subsequent transition to elastic turbulence is crucial from a fundamental point of view and for many important practical applications involving engineered complex fluids, such as the design of microfluidic mixers for efficient operation under inertialess flow conditions, or the development of highly efficient micron-sized energy management and mass transfer systems.

This will be achieved through the development of novel multi-scale technologies (nano- to macro) and materials that, once integrated, will allow distributed local/global sensing and morphing capabilities that can be exploited for structural as well as for eminently flexible applications. The distributed local/global morphing and sensing will be delivered by fabricating at the microscale a non-invasive, light-weight, flexible and highly expandable active network with enhanced actuation capabilities and a neurological sensor network. The networks are then expanded to the macro-scale prior being integrated in a flexible material or in an innovative multi-stable shape memory carbon-fiber composite. The sensor network has to monitor environmental and loading conditions. These data are then used to control the deformation of the active network which can deliver local (roughness changes as in dolphins skin for instance for drag reduction) or global morphing (e.g. for deformable textiles as in insect wings) in flexible materials. The multi-stable carbon-fiber composite can be used in conjunction with these two functions so as to achieve advanced morphing in structural applications (e.g., birds wings vs. aircrafts wings). The composite, with a shape memory resin as hosting matrix, due to its rigidity and sensitivity to temperature variations, can snap from one configuration to the other. The speed of the purposefully-introduced snapping-through process will be tuned with the help of the integrated active network.

The electrospinning is based on the uniaxial elongation of polymeric jets with sufficient molecular entanglements, in presence of an intense electric field. It is a unique approach to produce nanofibers with high throughput. However, the process is still largely suboptimal, the most of nanofiber production being still carried out on an empirical basis. Though operationally simple, electrospinning is indeed complex as the behavior of electrified jets depends on many experimental variables making fully predictive approaches still missing. This project aims to elucidating and engineering the still unclear working principles of electrospinning by solutions incorporating active materials, with a tight synergy among modeling, fast-imaging characterization of electrified jets, and process engineering. Once optimized, nanofibers will offer an effective, well-controllable and cheap material for building new, cavity-free random laser systems. These architectures will enable enhanced miniaturization and portability, and enormously reduced realization costs. Electrospun nanofibers will offer a unique combination of optical properties, tuneable topography and light scattering effectiveness, thus being an exceptional bench tool to realize such new low-cost lasers, which is the second project goal. The accomplishment of these ambitious but well-defined objectives will have a groundbreaking, interdisciplinary impact, from materials science to physics of fluid jets in strong elongational conditions, from process to device engineering.

The overall goal of this proposal is to provide the enabling technology in form of novel computational and experimental methodologies to assist the design process of next-generation prosthetic devices. The focus hereby is to gain a better understanding of the dynamics of the musculoskeletal system of a lower extremity amputee, here, the stump of an above-knee amputee.

To counteract the increase of computational cost by switching from 1D lumped-parameter models to 3D models, novel, elegant, and efficient algorithms, e.g. nested iteration techniques tuned for efficiency through model-based coupling strategies and optimised solvers, need to be developed. The second aim is to experimentally measure physical quantities that provide the necessary input to drive the forward dynamics model, e.g. EMG, and to provide means of validation, e.g. with respect to pressure measurements, ultrasound recordings, and motion capture.

Resulting behaviour and responses of cells are substantially different from those observed within natural extracellular matrices (ECM). The early designs of 3D cell-culture matrices focused on their bulk properties, while disregarding individual cell environment. However, recent findings indicate that the role of the ECM extends beyond a simple structural support to regulation of cell and tissue function. So far the mechanisms of this regulation are not fully understood, due to technical limitations of available research tools, diversity of tissues and complexity of cell-matrix interactions. The main goal of this project is to develop a versatile and straightforward method, enabling systematic studies of cell-matrix interactions. 3D CAD matrices will be produced by femtosecond laser-induced polymerization of hydrogels with cells in them. Cell embedment results in a tissue-like intimate cell-matrix contact and appropriate cell densities right from the start. A unique advantage of the LeBMEC is its capability to alter on demand a multitude of individual properties of produced 3D matrices, including: geometry, stiffness, and cell adhesion properties. It allows us systematically reconstruct and identify the key biomimetic properties of the ECM in vitro. The particular focus of this project is on the role of local mechanical properties of produced hydrogel constructs. It is known that, stem cells on soft 2D substrates differentiate into neurons, stiffer substrates induce bone cells, and intermediate ones result in myoblasts. With LeBMEC, a controlled distribution of site-specific stiffness within the same hydrogel matrix can be achieved in 3D.

101042339;MoveMeRU;"Moving Russia(ns): Intergenerational Transmission of Memories Abroad and at Home";"Children of migrants are exposed to two national histories: those told in their country of residence and those relating to their family?s homeland. However, it remains unclear how the intergenerational transmission of historical views shapes the relationship migrants cultivate with ?here? and ?there?. Applying theories of intergenerational transmission and second-generation transnationalism, MoveMeRU addresses this urgent gap and compares the historical memories of migrants and non-migrants across two generations. It studies the Russian migrant population in a favourable, hostile and neutral reception context, looking at Germany, Estonia and Canada. Like many other autocracies, Russia uses historical memories to appeal to the emotions of citizens at home and abroad and strengthen their sense of belonging to Russia. The project will make major academic contributions in three areas: 1) understanding the historical identification of young adults in migrant and non-migrant families with their parents? country of origin. 2) identifying when the memories of migrant and non-migrant families converge or diverge across generations. 3) determining what historical memories contribute to solidarity and pluralistic political attitudes. MoveMeRU entails a groundbreaking triangulation of methods: 1) parent-child opinion surveys on views on history among migrant communities and nationals in the three countries of destination and Russia. 2) cross-generational focus groups in the same countries. 3) analysis of historical narratives in media targeting Russian speakers abroad. The project will refine our understanding of differences and similarities in the intergenerational transmission of memories in migrant and non-migrant families, offering important insights into the drivers of and obstacles to integration. The results have major implications for political decision-making in countries of destination and for public awareness about intergenerational shifts within migrant communities.";KRAWATZEK Félix;Starting grants;SH7 - Human Mobility, Environment & Space;1.500.000;ERC-2021-STG;Centre for East European and International Studies (ZOiS);BERLIN;DE
101039455;SEGUE;"Urban Economic SEGregation: integrating explanatory mechanisms across geographical scales to compare remediatory policies in silico";"The uneven concentration of people and economic resources in cities hampers the well-being and opportunities of poorer citizens and represents a threat to social cohesion. It is considered a major policy challenge by researchers and international institutions alike. My aim with the SEGUE project is to identify and model the combination of economic, geographical and demographical drivers of urban economic segregation in order to better understand its dynamics and to better assess possible remediatory policies. The existing literature on urban segregation mainly explains urban economic segregation with sociological and intra-city factors (resource accessibility, social networks, contextual effects and the urban form) but also acknowledges a link with the evolution of economic inequality. The existing literature on economic inequality, by contrast, mainly focuses on factors operating at the national and individual levels (selective migration, assortative mating, family inheritance, education). My project addresses this gap by spatialising the national and individual explanations of economic inequality relating to residential mobility or the tax and education system, and by integrating these into a simulation model of urban segregation. This model will be calibrated with a uniquely rich source of exhaustive and longitudinal individual data from the Netherlands. Its analysis will produce new insights about the interaction between drivers of economic inequality and segregation in cities and will provide a cost-effective tool to compare policies to reduce urban economic segregation at different scales of action (local, urban, national), ex ante (i.e. within the virtual laboratory of a simulation) instead of in situ with costly and risky experiments. The results obtained from the research should also open new perspectives to study various forms of inequality and facilitate the study of economic segregation in other national contexts.";COTTINEAU Clémentine;Starting grants;SH7 - Human Mobility, Environment & Space;1.495.125;ERC-2021-STG;Delft University of Technology;DELFT;NL
101039222;SUperSAFE;"SUrrogate measures for SAFE autonomous and connected mobility";"SUperSAFE "SUrrogate measures for SAFE autonomous and connected mobility" will address the problem of the safety evaluation of the interaction between conventional vehicles and connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). The project builds on the notion that vehicle automation is posing new risks that the traditional accident-based and proactive safety analysis methods are unable to investigate. In SUperSAFE, I will select the relevant variables drew on the newly identified risks posed by CAVs, and with these I will develop a new proactive method based on surrogate measures of safety for studying the effects of the physical and digital infrastructure on the interaction between road users in a mixed-mobility environment. Also considering the benchmarks for cities’ liveability and transport sustainability that include road casualties as a primary factor, the European White Paper on Transport calls to reach zero fatalities by 2050 following Vision Zero’s policy (zero serious casualties). Recent statistics indicate a reduction of traffic accidents but also that this development has slowed and additional efforts are required. At the same time, CAVs are already a reality. Tendency towards vehicle automation is even more evident in the European policies which encourage member states to push with the introduction of vehicles with advanced driver assistance systems. However, the road towards full automation is still not open because there is a fear of crashes/injuries and low acceptance of potential CAV accidents. This is mainly because the CAVs’ behaviour vis-a-vis the conventional vehicles on the road and the digital and physical infrastructure is still unknown. To meet these rapidly approaching needs, I propose SUperSAFE, which will contribute to attaining the aforementioned European goals by developing a scientifically rigorous method of estimating risk based on the road users’ real needs to improve traffic safety in the transition period to fully automated driving.";D'AGOSTINO Carmelo;Starting grants;SH7 - Human Mobility, Environment & Space;1.500.000;ERC-2021-STG;Lund University;LUND;SE
101040492;FragMent;"Geographic environments, daily activities and stress: a study on the space-time fragmentation of exposure patterns";"Stress is nearly ubiquitous in everyday life, and imposes a tremendous burden worldwide by acting as a major risk factor of mental disorders, autoimmune, infectious and cardiovascular diseases, and some cancers. The aim of the FragMent project is to evaluate to which extent the spatial and temporal fragmentation of exposures to environments in daily life influences physiological and psychological stress, as well as social inequalities in stress. Some evidence shows that exposures to daily environments may either act as a stress contributor or provide some stress restorative qualities. While the protective effect of greenness has been clearly established, strong uncertainties remain regarding the effects of urban environments. FragMent starts from this premise to investigate the environmental determinants of momentary, daily and chronic stress in relation with immediate, daily and regular environmental exposures. The project uncovers the role of spatiality and temporality in exposure effects on stress. It further builds on the concept of space-time activity fragmentation, to contextualize patterns of exposure within activity patterns. Finally, it analyses how differences in space-time exposures and activity patterns across social groups may lead to social inequalities in stress. An observational cohort study will be used to evaluate momentary, daily and chronic stress in daily life, using a combination of traditional web-survey, map-based questionnaires, smartphone tracking and Geographic Ecological Momentary Assessment. A series of lab-based experiments, combining Immersive Virtual Environments with a walking simulator, will assess the effect of urban environmental characteristics and the temporality of exposures on momentary physiological and psychological stress. Bridging knowledge from epidemiology and time geography, FragMent will provide critical evidence to equitably reduce exposure to environmental stressors in outdoor space in everyday life.";PERCHOUX Camille Josépha Victorine;Starting grants;SH7 - Human Mobility, Environment & Space;1.496.821;ERC-2021-STG;Luxembourg Institute of Socio-Economic Research (LISER);ESCH SUR ALZETTE;LU
101041069;ARISER;"Access to crop diversity and small farms’ resilience to climate variability in African drylands: The role of seed and information networks";"Crop diversity is a key resource for smallholder farmers in drylands, as it plays a major role in their resilience by stabilizing crop production in the face of climate variability. Although access to crop diversity is pivotal for these farmers, the processes driving access are not fully understood. Previous research indicates that access to crop diversity may rely on the social networks through which crop seeds and information are diffused. These networks display a wide diversity of patterns, including differences in the composition of the actors involved and in the structure of the pathways through which seeds and information diffuse. Understanding the consequences of these different network patterns for crop diversity and their implication for farm resilience is a crucial and timely challenge. In this project, I will address this challenge by combining theory and methods from agroecology and social network research to tackle three objectives: (1) identify the most critical network patterns to maintain high crop diversity on farms over time or to change crops, (2) assess the relation between network patterns and temporal stability of crop production at the farm level, and (3) assess how farmers socioeconomic characteristics affect their access to seed and information. To reach these objectives, I will (i) design a standardized protocol to collect longitudinal and panel data across three dryland areas in Africa, which could serve as a reference for future studies, (ii) build an innovative simulation model combining agent-based and network approaches, and (iii) develop new statistical methods for network analysis. This project will enable a major advance in our understanding of the processes driving farmers access to crop diversity and their resilience. By doing so, it will contribute to improve decision-making for smallholder farmers adaptation to increased climate variability in drylands.";LABEYRIE Vanesse;Starting grants;SH7 - Human Mobility, Environment & Space;1.500.000;ERC-2021-STG;Organisation for International Cooperation and Agricultural Research for Development (CIRAD);Paris;FR
101039376;INFLUX;"Emerging pests and pathogens as a novel lens for unravelling social-ecological cascades";"Emerging pests and pathogens (EPPs) are an increasingly disruptive force to human society that can cause large social and ecological changes far beyond their initial site of emergence. Three forces contribute to this growing challenge now and in the foreseeable future: first, potential EPPs are more likely to come in to first contact with human habitats as human land use expands. Second, denser human trade and travel networks mean that EPPs are more likely to emerge in new regions. Third, human technology, such as biocidal agents, increases risks for re-emergence. Understanding how EPPs cascade across scales in social-ecological systems is therefore an urgent priority, but no formal approach currently exists for analysing the ripple effects at scale, from their seeding to their lasting societal imprints. This project aims to fill this gap in sustainability science for society. The INFLUX project will test the hypothesis that EPPs commonly cascade to interact with large-scale social and environmental challenges and that small differences in social-ecological conditions in turn influence the likelihood and nature of EPP cascades. I will test this hypothesis by leveraging a comparative, mixed-methods research design to assemble a large database for up to 1600 EPPs, encompassing microbial pathogens as well as arthropod and plant pests. Specifically, four objectives will be pursued, which are to understand: 1. The drivers of emergence risk and their connections to human environmental sustainability and social conditions. 2. The types of cascades that result from action aimed at governing EPPs. 3. The lasting impacts EPPs have on societies and the conditions under which they arise. 4. The feedbacks from 3.-1. including through implications for social equity and environmental sustainability. INFLUX constitutes a major step in situating EPPs in the field of sustainability science, and for developing societal capacity to navigate a future characterized by them";SØGAARD JØRGENSEN Peter;Starting grants;SH7 - Human Mobility, Environment & Space;1.499.705;ERC-2021-STG;Stockholm University;STOCKHOLM;SE
101039545;DECYCLE;"Towards a circular degrowth economy: Explaining the material valorization regime of city-regions";"A transition towards a degrowth economy is necessary to tackle the related challenges of resource scarcity and waste accumulation. Degrowth pursues socio-economic wealth while reducing material flows and reusing waste in socially responsible and ecologically regenerative ways. As a concrete approach to realizing these ends, the concept of the circular economy has gathered political momentum. However, this model will have no impact on city-regions' ecological footprint unless it challenges the regulations that dismiss certain materials as waste in the first place. DECYCLE lays the groundwork for studying the regulatory frameworks that make it possible to revalue waste materials as a resource for city-regional development. It develops an approach termed 'institutional urban political ecology', which combines city-regions' regulatory, spatial, and ecological dimensions, usually studied separately. It interrogates the legal, spatial, and economic regulations that define waste streams' political responsibilities, geographies, and financial architecture. DECYCLE puts forward a new concept, the material valorization regime, to explain how these regulations govern the valorization of waste across multiple scales. It develops a distinct new method of 'enactment tracing' for critical urban research, which involves mapping actors engaged in defending and contesting regulations. DECYCLE comparatively analyzes how regulations valorize streams of construction, food, and heat waste in Hamburg, Amsterdam, Barcelona, Vienna, and Milan. It also explains how transnational regulatory frameworks affect waste reduction at the city-regional scale. By theorizing the relationship between regulatory change and the urban metabolism in contemporary eco-capitalism, DECYCLE sets out to free urbanization from its dependency on the production of waste and raw materials. In so doing, it lays the foundations for future socio-spatial inquiry into the institutional basis of city-regional metabolisms.";SAVINI Federico;Starting grants;SH7 - Human Mobility, Environment & Space;1.431.711;ERC-2021-STG;University of Amsterdam;AMSTERDAM;NL
101040247;MENTALNET;"Effects of mental disorders on the wellbeing and prosperity of family members and friends";"Mental disorders have an enduring impact on individuals wellbeing and economic prosperity. Although it is often assumed that these effects extend to the wellbeing of family members and friends as well, comprehensive large-scale direct investigations have rarely been conducted and it remains unclear how enduring these influences are. This project addresses this fundamental gap in our understanding and substantially extends prior knowledge in two crucial ways. First, I will estimate how much a person?s mental disorder affects the wellbeing and prosperity of family members, including parents and siblings. Second, I study whether these effects extend to partners in later adulthood. Third, I will assess the broader social impact of mental illness across the life course, also estimating the longevity of these wider harmful influences. My research team and I will use several interlinked nationwide Finnish registers to answer these questions. The linked datasets contain rich individual-level information for over three decades for the whole Finnish population, including complete details of healthcare utilization and prescription medication prescribing for approximately 5 million persons over a 20-year observation period. The main advantage of these nationwide registers is that they are truly population-based and free of the biases that are common in research surveys. My team will use state-of-the-art research designs and statistical methods to identify potential causal links. MENTALNET will deliver cutting-edge knowledge on how mental disorders coalesce in social networks, which can potentially help to reduce the societal impact of mental disorders.";HAKULINEN Christian Antero;Starting grants;SH7 - Human Mobility, Environment & Space;1.499.494;ERC-2021-STG;University of Helsinki;HELSINKI;FI
101039426;B-WEX;"Balancing clean Water and Energy provision under changing climate and eXtremes";"Providing clean water and energy simultaneously to a growing global population and under a changing climate is a major challenge. The demand for the two and their systemic interdependencies are particularly strong during droughts and heatwaves. Despite the recent growth in water-energy nexus studies, there is little fundamental understanding of the cascading effects and feedbacks between water and energy systems during extreme weather events. Because existing global model approaches mainly focus on whole-system optimisation and are based on coarse spatiotemporal water and energy system representations, we lack understanding on how water-energy system processes cascade in time and space under a changing climate and extremes. Yet such understanding is urgently needed so that we can balance clean water and energy provision in our changing world in which climate shocks are increasing. In B-WEX, I will develop spatially explicit pathways that reveal how the provision of clean water and energy can be balanced under various water management and energy transition developments, including the feedbacks and cascading mechanisms under present to future droughts and heatwaves in regions worldwide. With my team, I will build a novel global framework which will be the first to integrate high spatiotemporal resolution models of hydrology, water quality, water use and energy systems to estimate how water and energy system processes cascade in time and space. Together with key actors, we will also develop quantitative water management and energy transition (climate action) pathways, which we will then combine with our new framework, enabling us to estimate trade-offs between water and energy systems during present to future droughts and heatwaves. The B-WEX project will greatly deepen our understanding of the cascading effects and feedbacks between clean water and energy systems development that occur under changing climate and extremes, and including climate mitigation actions.";VAN VLIET Michelle;Starting grants;SH7 - Human Mobility, Environment & Space;1.500.000;ERC-2021-STG;Utrecht University;UTRECHT;NL
101041110;GROW;"GROundWater sustainability and crop production";"Groundwater is the largest freshwater resource on earth and is crucial for people and the environment. In many regions around the world, groundwater is used unsustainably. Consequently, groundwater levels drop leading to drying rivers and wells, salt intrusion, land subsidence, and groundwater depletion. Irrigated agriculture is the largest user of groundwater worldwide and is responsible for current hotspots of negative impacts, especially for intensively irrigated regions of the world. Already, many rivers in these regions have reached their environmentally critical streamflow, which is necessary to maintain healthy ecosystems. With expected increasing water demands and climate change, the pressure on our groundwater resources will increase further and new regions experiencing negative impacts will develop. To reduce and prevent these impacts, groundwater uses should be reduced. At the same time, crop productivity should be maintained to protect global food security. This poses for me the urgent question: What is the current and future environmentally safe operation space for global groundwater use and what is, and will be, the impact of sustainable groundwater use on crop production worldwide? In this project, I will provide a better understanding of groundwater availability worldwide. My project will define the environmentally safe operating space for current and future groundwater use and will define and quantify the key trade-offs between sustainable groundwater use and crop production. I will develop a novel and innovative modelling framework that connects groundwater, surface water, and crop growth. The model will be linked novel future water demand scenarios, including adaptation strategies towards sustainable groundwater use worldwide. The results will show globally where and when competition for groundwater between the environment and crop production is largest and whether sustainable groundwater use can support current and future crop production.";DE GRAAF Inge;Starting grants;SH7 - Human Mobility, Environment & Space;1.404.141;ERC-2021-STG;Wageningen University;Wageningen;NL

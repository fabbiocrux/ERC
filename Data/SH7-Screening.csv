DEMOTRADEOFF,Reconciling Citizens with the Tradeoffs of Democracy: Attitudes Toward Democracy Under Rising Politicization,"Democracies involve tradeoffs since all their desirable qualities cannot be simultaneously maximized. Hard choices must be made in order to balance democratic principles such as popular sovereignty and the rule of law, or freedom and political equality. These tradeoffs would not be problematic as long as citizens and political leaders were open to compromise and accept that democracy requires a delicate balancing of virtues. The politicization of these tradeoffs in recent events such as Brexit or Poland’s judicial reform suggests that this is likely not the case. However, we still know very little about the positions of citizens and parties regarding democratic tradeoffs. how these contribute to citizens’ increasing discontent with democracy. how the rising politicization of the tradeoffs of democracy might exacerbate these dynamics. and whether it is possible to curb this process. To investigate these questions this project: (1) elaborates a conceptual map of democratic tradeoffs and empirically examines citizens’ preferences and parties’ positions on them. (2) analyzes the determinants of citizens’ democratic tradeoff preferences, and how the interplay between these preferences and parties’ politicization of these tradeoffs affects individuals’ support and satisfaction with democracy. (3) examines how citizens can be reconciled with the idea that some democratic qualities cannot be simultaneously maximized. The empirical analysis focuses on 15 European countries and implements an integrative multi-method approach combining cross-sectional and panel surveys, content analysis, and experiments. The proposed project breaks new theoretical and methodological ground in the study of political culture. It brings the inherent tensions of democracy to the forefront and develops new tools for the measurement of tradeoff preferences and their consequences."
LIVE-AR,The subsequent lives of Arab revolutionaries,"What are the biographical consequences and the social outcomes of revolutionary activism when the revolutionary moment turns into a civil war, an authoritarian restoration, a fragile democratic transition, or a return to the former 'years of lead'? LIVE-AR will develop a novel and ambitious analytical approach that will focus on the 'subsequent lives' of ordinary revolutionaries in four contrasted case-studies: Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt and Syria. By articulating the micro and meso levels, it will propose a groundbreaking three-fold shift from the usual viewpoint: a) from the revolutionary moment to the 'subsequent lives' of the women and men who participated in these events and a longitudinal analysis. b) from political and state institutions and macro-political transformations to the ordinary activists and the individual level. and c) from national studies to cross-national comparisons in order to comprehend patterns and variations depending on the political context. This analytical framework will unfold along four intertwined lines of research: 1) activist careers and biographical consequences, 2) 'emotional legacies', 3) revolutionary interpersonal networks, 4) revolutionary organizations. In so doing it will not only contribute to the literature on social movements, activism and contentious politics, by providing if not a collective biography at least a detailed 'mosaic of life-stories' of activists from the Global South, but also to the field of comparative politics to which it will offer original and empirically-grounded data to document the multiple possible social outcomes of revolutionary processes as they unfold in non-democratic contexts. The project will rely on a multidisciplinary skilled team and devise a diversified qualitative methodological 'toolkit' combining life story interviews with life calendars, an analysis of digital social networks and internet archives, ethnographic observations of daily life practices and encounters, and secondary sources."
E-BoP,European Birds of Passage - An Empirical Legal Theory of Temporary Labour Migration in Europe,"The E-BoP project is an innovative study of the legal framework for temporary labour migration in the European Union (EU). While unevenly researched, the subject is hotly debated and in continuous expansion. Temporary labour migration increasingly represents the compromise between calls to take back control of borders, and the demands from employers of access to migrant workforce. The legal regulation of this phenomenon is grounded on concepts, such as temporariness and labour market, which are either not defined by the law or in conflict with their socio-economic reality. E-BoP explores these concepts through an empirical legal analysis to address the foundations of the legal framework for temporary labour migration in the EU. In doing so, it covers forms of temporary labour migration which legal doctrine has never analysed together, namely posting of workers, seasonal work, and intra-corporate transfers. The project aims to answer a set of questions concerning this legal framework: what is the implicit definition of labour market accepted by legislation and courts, and what are its boundaries? What does the law mean when it classifies certain migrant workers as temporary? What would be the legal and socio-economic consequences of conceiving temporary labour migrants as fully integrated in the Member State where they perform their work? The E-BoP project triangulates the results of a systematic analysis of legal documents with quantitative analysis of the phenomena at stake to explore the real world meaning of concepts upon which the legal regulation of temporary labour migration in the EU is construed. As such, the ambition of E-BoP extends beyond the field of labour and social rights, and into other legal disciplines and branches of social sciences. Considering how the legal construction influences employment statistics, leading to the undercounting of temporary labour migrants, the project challenges the societal perception of reality."
PatentsInHumans,"Patents, Bioethics and the Human Body: Reconceptualising Bioethics in Patent Decision-Making and the Governance Function of Patents","PatentsInHumans challenges the current marginalisation of bioethics in patent decision-making for technologies related to the human body. A patent gives a rightsholder the right to stop others using a patented technology. This allows them to control how that technology is provided, to whom, and on what terms. Where patents are for technologies related to the body, this control poses considerable bioethical issues because patents can affect how we treat, use and modify bodies. Yet patent systems generally do not engage with such implications. All patents are treated the same, regardless of the underlying technology i.e. a patent on an engine part is treated the same as a patent on a medicine, despite the significant effects the latter has for health. PatentsInHumans proposes that there is a self-reinforcing cycle where patents are granted even if bioethical implications are posed by patents over such technologies. that there are limited incentives for rightsholders to license patents in a way that addresses bioethical implications, and that patents, once granted, are difficult to challenge if bioethical issues arise. PatentsInHumans radically reconceptualises patents as governance devices over the body in such contexts. It proposes that when patents are applied for, the underlying technology’s relationship to the body must be considered. The project will therefore evaluate the bioethical implications that patents over such technologies have for how we treat, use, or modify our bodies. These implications must guide patent decision-making and the adoption of licensing or grant conditions that pre-empt bioethical issues. The project develops a cross disciplinary institutional analysis to evaluate key legal, structural and cultural barriers leading to the marginalisation of bioethics in patent decision-making, and to formulate pathways to bring bioethics into patent decision-making for technologies related to the body with important conceptual and policy implications"
PINPOINT,"Politics, Institutions, and Production Networks","What are the political sources and consequences of economic globalization, and how do political institutions shape globalization? Current frameworks for understanding the politics over economic globalization emphasize a fragmentation of politics: political conflict breaks down to individual firms and citizens, because the gains from trade are concentrated on large, globally engaged, and politically active firms. Departing from this view, PINPOINT develops an innovative framework built on the linkages between firms created by domestic production networks. Production ties imply a much broader impact of economic globalization, because many domestic firms interact with international markets indirectly as suppliers and as customers of globally engaged firms. Moreover, these linkages vary in quantity and quality. To date, we know surprisingly little about the role of production networks in politics, which creates a mismatch between the structure of modern economies and current theoretical frameworks. Ignoring such ties risks misattributing the impact of economic globalization, overlooking economic roots of political coalitions, and misunderstanding the sources and consequences of economic globalization. PINPOINT places economic exchange between firms front and center in an account of the behavior of governments, firms, and citizens in the context of international markets, and of the role of institutions in such an account. PINPOINT will provide theoretical and empirical innovations that lead to a revised understanding of the political underpinnings of economic globalization and of the mechanisms through which institutions shape economic globalization."
TransLitigate,The Agency of Transnational Strategic Litigators in Global Governance,"Litigators feature in a crucial role as we confront the pressing global environmental governance challenges of the 21st Century. They possess an agency which is capable of driving the evolution and implementation of law across national boundaries and at the supranational level. This project proposes to develop a groundbreaking, explanatory model of transnational collaborations among strategic litigators which accounts for their modes of collaboration, how those collaborations affect their agency in controlling the issues in their respective fields, and how they negotiate complex ethical and professional challenges in their work. It proposes to develop this model through the combination of comparative doctrinal research and inductive qualitative socio-legal research across four case studies of strategic litigation: climate change, large-scale land transfers, pollution caused by extractives industries, and species conservation. It pursues the ground-breaking aim of explaining the multi-faceted and complex deliberations among transnational communities of litigators which give rise to and shape the landmark cases transforming environmental governance in diverse national contexts. With this contribution to the sociology of strategic litigators, the project will achieve a break-through in our understanding of how change can be initiated in legal systems to overcome perpetual obstacles and meet our global environmental challenges. It pursues a breakthrough in understanding how litigators drive states and their legal systems to act upon their ability to govern global environmental challenges, given the unlikeliness of it occurring through domestic and international lawmaking alone. In sum, the project aims to develop a groundbreaking model of an innovative type of agency and actor in global governance: the strategic litigator collaborating across borders."
FARRIO,The Effects of Far Right Challenges on International Organizations,"The rise of the far right poses a profound challenge to global politics. Diverse far-right actors, such as political parties, civil society groups, and social movements, have been gaining support in domestic contexts, while intensifying their transnational contacts. As these groups focus on national sovereignty and share a stance against globalization, they often contest international organizations (IOs) and their policies. Yet their impact on international organizations differs: On the one hand, far-right groups have profoundly changed negotiations on the Global Compact for Migration in the UN. On the other hand, radical-right parties in the European Parliament have hardly brought about any deeper policy changes. Why does transnational far-right contestation have varying effects on international organizations? While scholars have analyzed far-right actors in domestic politics, knowledge about their transnational activities and effects is limited. FARRIO fills this gap empirically, theoretically, and methodologically. Empirically, it compares effects of far-right contestation on the EU, the UN, and its specialized agencies/treaties in four central policy fields (migration, women's rights, climate change, and public health). Theoretically, it proposes that IO changes depend on the directness of far-right strategies and the liberal character of international organizations. It thereby breaks new ground in identifying scope conditions for far-right impact highly relevant for research on transnational protest as well as IO resilience and change. Methodologically, FARRIO draws on and further develops quantitative and qualitative methods. It adapts protest event and networks analysis to map transnational far-right contestation, also including social media data. Bridging Comparative Politics, Social Movement Studies, and the study of International Relations, FARRIO assesses the challenge far-right actors pose to IOs as well as what measures are suited to respond to it."
INTRAPARTY,The Benefits of Conflict: How Factions Can Enhance Political Parties' Electoral Performance,"DNA damage contributes to the ageing of tissues and causes mutations that drive cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying many mutational processes are not understood, and neither is how much they contribute to disease. With a powerful new technology, I propose to close these major gaps for common ?clock? mutations of unknown origin. The recent genome sequencing revolution has revealed unexpected diversity in mutational patterns. One pattern in particular is intriguing as it behaves as a molecular ?clock?: the number of mutations increases over time and correlates with age. Although the textbook view of mutagenesis is that cell division is required to convert DNA damage into point mutations, surprisingly, non-dividing cells like neurons also accumulate ?clock? mutations as a function of time, indicating that ?clock? mutations arise without genome replication. Understanding how cells mutate independently of proliferation?and thus challenging the current paradigm of mutagenesis?is a fundamental question that has been hindered because assays to measure mutation require cell division. Excitingly, I have overcome this major obstacle by establishing a powerful strategy to sensitively detect mutations in single cells, genome-wide. My group will combine this approach with targeted genetic manipulations in cells and mice to answer two central questions. (1) How do cells mutate independently of proliferation? (2) What drives these mutations in tissues? My novel insights into endogenous DNA damage from mouse genetics and genomics, combined with the innovative sequencing strategy that I have established, uniquely position me to answer these long-standing questions. Together, the work proposed here will reveal the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the most common mutational process in humans: ?clock? mutation. The methods, data, and insights from these groundbreaking studies will directly impact cancer research and uncover novel sources of DNA damage during aging"
MANIFEST,MechANIsms and actors of Feasible Energy Transitions,"The technologies needed to decarbonize the electricity system are already commercially available. There are mathematical models of how these technologies can be deployed sufficiently fast and at a large enough scale to displace fossil fuels to meet climate targets. Yet there is no scientific method to evaluate whether these scenarios are feasible given the real world’s socio-political constraints. MANIFEST develops a new scientific understanding of socio-political feasibility of climate change mitigation that takes into account the context, actors and change over time. Theoretically, MANIFEST combines a definition of socio-political feasibility from political philosophy with the concept of causal mechanisms of energy transitions. Thus, I shift the thinking about the feasibility of climate change mitigation from its current focus on barriers and enablers to a dynamic and context sensitive view with space for actors and agency. Empirically, I focus on transitions in electricity supply including the expansion of low-carbon electricity and coal phase-out. I explore three areas which are critical for the feasibility of decarbonisation of electricity: (i) the role and capacities of international suppliers of electricity technologies, (ii) the competition between electricity technologies at the early stages of their introduction in emerging economies, and (iii) factors shaping the growth of low-carbon technologies and under what conditions they substitute carbon-intensive ones. Methodologically, I develop a new approach to assess the feasibility of climate solutions by constructing dynamic feasibility spaces which are a function of paths, contexts and actors. I test this approach by analysing national low-carbon electricity targets to determine whether states plan to accelerate decarbonisation beyond the current feasibility frontier. This dynamic feasibility space is a breakthrough in assessing the feasibility of national and global climate change mitigation solutions."
GRIP-ARM,Green Industrial Policy in the Age of Rare Metals: A Transregional Comparison of Growth Strategies in Rare Earth Mining,"Our new global political economy is increasingly defined by ‘critical raw materials’ – of which rare earths elements (or ‘rare earths’) are the most significant. The proposed study examines the globalized supply and demand for rare earths – from mining, processing, manufacturing, use and recycling – to have a closer scrutiny of mining both as a strategy for industrialization and as an integral part of contemporary efforts towards a sustainable supply of raw materials. GRIP-ARM interrogates the dynamics in rare earth mining that might lend this particular resource a tool for economic development. The project seeks to answer the following questions: (1) How do state capacity, business power and organizational structure of domestic markets shape the design of industrial policies in resource-rich countries? (2) What explains the success of some countries in generating linkages between resource extraction and manufacturing, and what accounts for their failure? (3) How effective are the responses of importing countries and their manufacturing industries in securing a stable supply while reducing the socio-environmental costs of extraction? The proposed research is one of the first systematic, comparative study on rare earths mining and economic development, which brings political science perspectives in conversation with natural resource geography and international political economy."
PerfectSTORM,STOrylines of futuRe extreMes,"Future climate projections show a strengthening of the hydrological cycle with more droughts and floods expected. This means a higher likelihood of cascading drought-to-flood disasters such as the Millennium Drought – Brisbane flooding in Australia or the California drought – Oroville spillway collapse in the US. Current research and management treat floods and droughts as independent, which leads to large underestimations of their future risk. Droughts allow ample time for impacts and adaptation, which influence hazard, exposure, and vulnerability of a subsequent flood. There are anecdotal examples of these events, but research is needed on the underlying interactions between hydrology and society. In the PerfectSTORM project (‘STOrylines of futuRe extreMes’), I propose to study drought-to-flood events to provide the understanding needed to prevent major disasters in the future. The innovative approach that I will develop is based on a combination of qualitative and quantitative storylines of past and future drought-to-flood risk in case studies and extrapolation of this rich case study information to the global scale. Qualitative storylines will be collected with narrative interviews and mental simulation workshops and will be edited and analysed. Quantitative storylines will be developed from timeseries of hydrological and social data that will be analysed and modelled. These storylines will then be combined in an iterative way using innovative data visualisation. A range of global datasets will be analysed to find global types and hotspots of drought-to-flood events and a global future 3D possibility space will be developed using socio-hydrological modelling. Positive pathways for future management of drought-to-flood events in different parts of the world will then be explored. The PerfectSTORM project will provide in-depth understanding of the hydrosocial feedbacks and dynamic vulnerability of cascading hazards."
RESOLVENCY,A GLOBAL THEORY OF REFLEXIVE DEBT (DELIBERATION),"Modern capitalism is essentially built on the institution of debt. The unlimited conception of debt reinforces an infinite growth logic and drives economic, political, cultural and ecological unsustainability. A crucial research question is how to constitute debt as more sustainable socio-economic medium. The RESOLVENCY project aims to shape a new (socially) reflexive debt paradigm by rethinking insolvency law as reflexive (democratic) debt deliberation. The project intends to set up a global theory of debt deliberation (for firms, consumers and states), which outlines a new RESOLVENCY paradigm for insolvency law reintegrating over-burdened debtors into the economic system (making them ‘re-solvent’) and incorporating other social (political, cultural, ecological) perspectives. ‘Resolving’ debt conflicts requires a collective procedure including debtor, creditors and all other private (employees, inhabitants) and public (communities, environment) interests involved. Advancing PI’s novel ‘discursive normative grammar’ (DNG) methodology and combining it with empirical methods, the project has four main objectives: (A) to reconstruct a universal argumentative frame (an insolvency DNG) for debt deliberation integrating normative principles (values) from corporate, consumer and sovereign insolvency theories across different jurisdictions. (B) to newly classify insolvency laws worldwide with a global comparative insolvency law theory based on this DNG. (C) to model and experiment with legal designs of reflexive debt deliberation procedures (RESOLVENCY law). and (D) to outline a model of reflexive debt (RE:DEBT) and analyse its ex ante effects on credit markets. The project does not only impact any legal and economic research on insolvency, but also debt theory in all social and sustainability sciences. In advancing PI’s DNG method, it enhances general understanding of deep normative architectures of legal reasoning and its constitutional effects for society at large."
Reintegrate,Reintegration Governance,"The Reintegrate project will combine the fields of reintegration and migration governance to establish a new sub-field of reintegration governance (RG). This project will develop a conceptual understanding of what is reintegration governance, its implementation and effectiveness and a new theoretical framework of how different forms of reintegration governance shape returnees reintegration outcomes across an in-depth comparative analysis of four different states: Ethiopia, Morocco, Nepal, and Serbia. The project is rooted in the nexus between policies and migrants agency by using a trajectories approach and active navigators to illustrate the role that returnees play in their own reintegration outcomes. The project makes several original contributions. First, this will be the first study that examines how reintegration is governed and will take a global approach to compare different regimes of RG. Second, the project uses an original analytical and empirical approach to compare RG across four case study countries that are each selected to represent a different form of RG. Ethiopia represents origin country led RG wherein the state has a national reintegration proclamation. Morocco represents supranational led RG characterized be an EU Readmission Agreement, IOM Assisted Voluntary Return Programmes (AVR), and a GIZ Migration Advisory Centre. Serbia represents high RG including both supranational and origin country led RG. Nepal represents low RG wherein only an IOM AVR programme is operational. Third, the reintegrate project addresses a gap in migration governance by bringing in the trajectories and navigation of returnees as a critical dimension in the analysis. The reintegrate project will have an impact on migration studies, human geography and political science through the establishment of the new sub-field of reintegration governance."
AWAR,Adapted to War,"Have humans evolved psychological adaptations to war? This question has generated major scientific debate involving anthropologists, archaeologists, economists, primatologists, psychologists, and political scientists. It has shaped popular perceptions of human nature and influenced the views of political leaders. Observing the limits of archaeological, ethnographic, and comparative evidence, I posit that only evidence of special design, obtained from an integrated program of psychological experiments, can conclusively answer this fundamental question. If humans are adapted to war, then human psychology must be equipped with specialized adaptations designed for the effective navigation of war: planning, executing, and defending against coalitional attacks. AWAR probes the existence of such adaptations. It focuses, specifically, on coalitional formidability assessment mechanisms, which likely helped ancestral humans to avoid costly fights. Such mechanisms, if revealed, likely constitute “smoking-gun” evidence that war shaped human evolution. AWAR also explores real-world implications of coalitional formidability assessment mechanisms: if they indeed exist, do they shape our attitudes and behavior today, particularly in the context of modern political violence (e.g., violent anti-government protests and armed civil conflicts)? AWAR presents the first elaborate information-processing model of a coalitional formidability assessment mechanism. In turn, it conducts an integrated program of 20 lab experiments and surveys in 40 countries. Crucially, AWAR holds the potential to reveal the existence of a psychological adaptation in humans, contributing to the growing efforts to map the universal architecture of the human mind. The project’s results will likely appear in major multidisciplinary journals, advancing scholarly debates in at least six disciplines. Most importantly, AWAR breaks new ground for a novel perspective in the study of modern domestic political violence."
MigrationRhythms,Migration rhythms in trajectories of upward social mobility in Asia,"Ninety percent of the global increase in the size of middle classes is occurring in Asia. What is driving this tremendous middle-class expansion and how is it related to the unprecedented levels of internal and international migration in that region? Specifically, what roles does migration play in Asian families’ trajectories into middle-classness over time? MigrationRhythms will investigate this question, discerning whether the roles of migration in trajectories of upward social mobility into middle-classness differ, and if so, how and why. The variation in distances and durations of migration among individuals in a family, over time, are described as migration rhythms. MigrationRhythms will produce a typology of different migration rhythms associated with specific trajectories of upward social mobility into the middle classes, which will enable a comprehensive theorization of the interaction of migration and social mobility of universal applicability, based on the unique data-rich Asian context. The combination of two distinct approaches will enable achieving MigrationRhythms’ objective of evaluating the roles of migration in trajectories of upward social mobility: First, the project employs a mixed-methods research design, encompassing family history interviews and quasi-longitudinal survey data from four Asian cities: Hanoi, Karachi, Manila and Mumbai. Second, it applies rhythmanalysis, as part of an inductive process-tracing framework, across the qualitative and quantitative data sets. This dual approach will enable the PI and two postdocs to identify the relative prevalence of different migration rhythms in families’ trajectories of upward social mobility into middle-classness. The PI will build on these analyses of migration rhythms to theorize the roles of spatial mobility (and immobility) in producing social mobility outcomes over the long-term, promising scientific advances in geography and migration studies, of relevance for research on social mobility."
FORESTPOLICY,Identifying the conditions under which forest-focused supply chain policies lead to improved conservation and livelihoods: a pan-tropical analysis,"Tropical forests are critical for human wellbeing through their contributions to climate stability, biodiversity conservation, food production, and rural livelihoods. Despite numerous global commitments to help conserve and restore tropical forests, these areas are disappearing faster than ever. The goal of this research is to provide major advancements in our understanding of the conditions under which forest-focused supply chain policies (FSPs), a form of voluntary environmental governance, can lead to improved conservation and livelihoods in the tropics. My proposal overcomes major methodological limitations of past work through four major innovations: i) a coordinated pan-tropical analysis of multiple forest-risk commodities, ii) simultaneous examination of conservation and livelihood outcomes, iii) a focus on mechanisms of impact, not just measures of impact, and iv) comparative study with triangulation across multiple scales and methods. I will examine the importance of four key contextual factors in determining FSP effectiveness: i) the degree of public sector involvement in the governance of land use behaviors in the target regions. ii) historical land use trends in the target regions. iii) supply chain arrangements for the targeted commodities. and iv) values of the targeted populations. Additionally, I examine how the type of implementation mechanism used (i.e., whether the firm immediately suspends non-compliant producers) interacts with these contextual factors in determining the effectiveness and equity of FSPs. By identifying the conditions under which different types of FSPs and related implementation mechanisms can deliver improved conservation and livelihood outcomes, the resulting analysis will provide urgently needed policy recommendations to companies and other policy makers for how to better tailor the design of FSPs to specific contexts."
GREENFIN,Effective green financial policies for the low-carbon transition,"Mitigating dangerous climate change requires a fundamental transition of global economies. This transition calls for an annual investment of 2–4 trillion USD, which is a multiple of current climate investment. Accordingly, the EU and many countries are enacting green financial policies, intervening in the financial sector to improve financing conditions for low-carbon technologies. Examples include green state investment banks, carbon disclosure requirements, and changes to lending regulations. However, the effect of these financial policies on investments in non-financial sectors such as energy, transport, or building is largely unknown. More specifically, we lack insights on how different low-carbon technologies require different types of finance (such as public vs. private finance, corporate vs. project finance, or equity vs. debt). Hence, it remains unclear how to make best use of such policies to fill the climate finance gap. By bridging disciplines and using novel data, GREENFIN will lead to a breakthrough in our understanding of the effects of financial policies on the low-carbon transition in non-financial sectors, and thereby lay the foundations for a new interdisciplinary field of financial policy analysis. First, combining theory from technology innovation studies and financial economics, I will derive how technology-inherent characteristics predict the demand for different types of finance. Second, using policy analysis tools and novel machine learning-based methods, I will analyze the effects of green financial policies on the supply of various types of finance. Third, combining these insights I will deliver specific recommendations for designing more effective green financial policies in the EU and beyond. By including financial policies in policy mix analyses, GREENFIN will crucially increase the overall analytical power of public policy analysis, which is all the more important given the ever-growing role of the financial sector in modern economies."
EmergentCommunity,Coexistence and conflict in the age of complexity: An interdisciplinary study of community dynamics,"Polarization and inequality amongst citizens are on the rise across Europe. In a context of multiple, and intersecting forms of diversity, peaceful coexistence has been increasingly placed under sustained pressure. Crucially, the urgency of finding sustainable solutions to these developments is constrained by a lack of conceptual and theoretical nuance that inhibits critical thinking about emergent constellations of social and political life. This project explores how affective orientations and everyday practices of peace and conflict intertwine and influence societies. In this respect, the study adopts an interdisciplinary research design that uses multi-sited ethnography, immersive virtual technologies, and psycho-physiological measuring to provide cutting-edge insight into community dynamics. The study will provide new grounded knowledge on how societies hold together whilst social and political positions within and between communities multiply. Using complexity as an analytical angle, the project considers the relations, tensions, and forms of collaboration that unfold in the course of everyday life in nine urban neighbourhoods in Finland, Sweden and France. The three countries share a mix of similarities and differences through which the variations in community dynamics and their societal consequences can be identified. Through the adopted interdisciplinary approach, the project will generate beyond state-of-the-art insight into how community dynamic in contemporary societies develops. It will use this knowledge to rethink the notion of community. In the final stage of the project, the empirical, methodological and conceptual insights will be combined to feed into the process of building a theory of emergent communities through which changes to the form of social and political life can be understood. The project will have a high societal impact by providing policymakers and politicians with knowledge on how social sustainability and inclusion can be promoted."
PROSPERA,"Prospering without growth: Science, Technology and Innovation in a post-growth era","The feasibility and desirability of endless economic growth is increasingly being questioned by scholars and activists. While envisioning alternative economic models is key to assure the sustainability and wellbeing of present and future generations, few studies have analysed what might be the role of ‘innovation’ in a post-growth era. Innovating has become the imperative for the survival and expansion of any form of organisation. But this ‘innovate or die mania’ underpins assumptions – such as technological determinism and productivism - that neglect the socially constructed character of technological development, its politics and its capacity to enable just and equitable societies but also dystopian technocratic futures. This project posits that untangling innovation from growth is key to imagining a post-growth era. If growth is going to be unsustainable, we need new narratives for innovation that would accordingly also have to change and increase the scope of the innovation concept itself, beyond technology, into cultural and institutional change, and indeed social life and social order. Organizations – in particular capitalist enterprises - are the core of modern industrial societies but are also one of the places in which the discourse of growth is legitimised and constantly reproduced. However, they can also be the places in which people can start to build the capacity for developing alternatives to challenges the growth ideology. But how organizations would look like in a different paradigm, in a system that is not based on and doesn’t not rely on endless growth? Under which conditions STI without growth would be able to flourish? What levels of technological complexity can we reach in a non-growing economy? What policies, infrastructures and organizational forms are needed or are more likely to facilitate this new paradigm of STI? These are questions, rarely asked by innovation, management and organization scholars, that the proposed project will address."
EUDAIMONIA,"National institutional autonomy within the EU legal order: uncovering and addressing its distinctive appearances, origins and impact on Member States' administrations","Despite significant advancements in European integration, the institutional design and organisation of administrative structures implementing and enforcing EU law had traditionally remained the responsibility of EU Member States. Over the past decade, however, EU legislation has increasingly come to impose more organisational requirements on those Member States’ administrative structures. That evolution is most remarkable as EU law has long recognised the existence of a principle of national institutional/administrative autonomy. That principle is to guarantee Member States’ freedom to designate and structure the administrative bodies responsible for the application and enforcement of EU rules. How far does the EU’s more extensive involvement in Member States’ administrative design decisions actually reach and can one find parallels between different fields of regulation? If so or if not, what are the implications for our understanding of institutional autonomy as a principle of EU (administrative) law? So far, legal scholarship, including the PI’s previous work on EU market supervision, has paid only scarce attention to those important questions. The principal objective of this project will be to analyse the scope of Member States’ administrative autonomy and to uncover, explain and conceptualise the limits that are imposed on it by EU law. To do so, it will first of all map and compare EU law’s influence over Member States’ administrative designs across 18 domains of regulation influenced by the EU. Since the traditional legal scholarship toolkit insufficiently allows to grasp the different factors having given rise to Member States’ administrative design decisions, the project will subsequently rely on actor-network theory (ANT) to uncover those factors. Using that particular research methodology, new and more extensive data obtained through in-depth case studies and questionnaires will allow to formulate theoretical modifications and policy recommendations."
realTRIPS,Redefining Variability: Evaluating Land Use and Transport Impacts on Urban Mobility Patterns,"Urban mobility analysis, advanced by the emerging fine-granularity location data (e.g. smart card data, mobile phone data and social media data), has received significant attention in recent years. It has become an important subject for understanding the functionality, ever-increasing dynamism and complexity of urban space. realTRIPS aims to open a new avenue of research in urban mobility analysis using emerging automatic data by developing an analytical and modelling framework, particularly addressing variability across spatial-temporal scales. I argue that the variability of urban mobility should not be simply interpreted as a number of errors, but indicators of changes in regular human behaviours impacted by land use and transport at different scales. A deeper understanding of variability and regularity would contribute to a more accurate prediction of urban development scenarios. The relevant theories and measures on variability have been long-researched in spatial statistics, but not well applied to the context of urban mobility studies. The proposed framework will take advantage of the research progress in multi-disciplines and leverage key concepts from uncertainty in spatial analysis, time geography, and land use transport planning. Under such framework, variability will be measured in mobility patterns and integrated as a function of space and time into operational urban models for predicting impact of land use and transport on people’s travel and location choices at different spatiotemporal scales. Case studies presenting typical urban contexts (i.e. London, Shenzhen, Nairobi) will be explored to demonstrate the feasibility and generic applicability of the theory, analytical methods and urban models."
CitizenGap,Legal Identity for All?,"Although we often think of undocumented persons as migrants or non-citizens, about one in seven people across the globe lack documents such as birth certificates, ID cards or passports to prove their legal identity, and thus their status as citizens in their own country. This gap between citizens with and without state-recognized documents is just as consequential as the distinction between citizens and non-citizens. Existing approaches portray the citizenship gap – the difference between legal status and the ability of citizens to document their claim to this status – as the apolitical by-product of deficiencies in governance. The proposed research project – CitizenGap – aims to change how scholars and policy-makers think about achieving one of the key targets of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals “By 2030, provide legal identity for all, including birth registration” by developing a novel political understanding. The project establishes the citizenship gap as a field of social scientific research, and pursues two main questions: (1) How and why do states invest in civil registration? (2) How and why do citizens decide to obtain documents? To understand why millions of citizens are undocumented, it is crucial to remember that citizenship is not only a legal status, but first and foremost a political relationship between states and the populations they govern. CitizenGap advances a strategic theory that seriously considers the incentives of states and citizens in the politics of civil registration. Empirically, the project contributes a comprehensive, cross-national measure that captures the number and characteristics of undocumented citizens, including those at risk of having their citizenship status questioned. The project analyzes the origins and nature of the citizenship gap in India and Mexico with a mixed methods design, combining demographic and spatial (GIS) datasets with fieldwork, archival sources, interviews and focus groups"
COMPASS,"Is environmental justice necessary for human well-being? Comparative analysis of certification schemes, inclusive business, and solidarity economy strategies","Unprecedented concentration in agri-food value chains is reinforcing global inequality. Waves of land grabbing threaten the livelihoods of millions. Reshaping the effects of agricultural investment, land use, and trade on human well-being is thus an urgent challenge. Certification schemes (CS) such as “Fairtrade” have become a common strategy to meet this challenge. However, accumulating evidence shows that many CS have limited effects on well-being. Inclusive business (IB) and solidarity economy (SE) strategies are emerging alternatives. Inclusiveness and solidarity are widely believed to enhance well-being, but evidence and theories disprove this common belief. Environmental justice may be a necessary condition to understand and reshape the effects of CS, IB, and SE on well-being. However, lack of reliable data and comparative analyses limits understanding of these links. COMPASS will tackle these challenges. This project aims to demonstrate how environmental justice influences the effects of CS, IB, and SE strategies on human well-being. COMPASS is organized in four work packages (WPs) and focuses on the cocoa and coffee sectors of Peru and Switzerland. WP1 surveys organizations (n=120) to compare their instruments used in CS, IB, and SE strategies. WP2 surveys households (n=840) and uses set-theoretic and process-tracing methodology to explain the effects of CS, IB, and SE on well-being. WP3 identifies the rules that organizations (n=18) create to regulate land use, investment and trade, assesses their environmental justice, and explains how they influence well-being. WP4 generates context-sensitive generalizations of these effects, and it tests and advances pertinent theories. COMPASS breaks new ground by systematically comparing CS, IB, and SE strategies and their effects on human well-being. It develops a new strand of environmental justice research on private-sector strategies and it tests the transformative potential of environmental justice."
EVICT,The Impact of the International Right to Housing on National Legal Discourse: Using Data Science Techniques to Analyse Eviction Litigation,"Eviction – the involuntary loss of one’s home – has a devastating impact on people’s wellbeing and has severe consequences for society as a whole. During and after the financial crisis of 2007-2011, over 700,000 people in Europe either lost their homes or were at risk of losing them. National courts use national laws to rule on whether an eviction is just. However, the right to housing, as laid down in international and European law, often demands more protection of the power- and propertyless than national laws prescribe. As a result, national courts are at the centre of the complex interaction between national and international law. In times of growing national resistance towards international law, the questions whether, how, and why international law impacts on national law are among the most topical that legal scholars face. Evictions provide a timely opportunity to determine why international rights, such as the right to housing, may or may not have an impact on national law. The financial crisis has led to an enormous amount of case law (legal big data). The combination of the developed, but understudied, international right to housing and these vast amounts of national data offers a unique opportunity to examine the interaction between international law and national law. It is impossible to analyse all judgments manually. Therefore, I will use a data-driven approach that is unique in the legal discipline. Using citation network analysis, I conceptualise the right to housing as a network of international rights and conduct the first empirical analysis of the impact of this right in case law from national supreme courts and lower level courts. With the use of machine learning, I will identify predictors for courts’ decisions, and explain how these predictors may mirror the right to housing. This approach has long been called for but, so far, rarely been executed. If successful, it could be used in future research projects in other areas of the law."
RECEDE,REgulating Criminal justicE DEtention: glocal prospects for improving health and safety in detention and society,"Overuse of detention and poor detention conditions create and compound serious problems for societies, presenting significant health and safety risks. Crime rates are not rising, but criminal justice detention is expanding. Substantial literature examines the disproportionate regulation of marginalised groups through criminal justice, but we know remarkably little about the regulation of criminal justice itself. Mechanisms for regulating detention have recently proliferated, but their effects on practice are largely unknown. This is a major evidence gap, which there is a compelling need to address. My project will develop the first comprehensive, empirically generated model of criminal justice detention regulation: RECEDE, which will facilitate new understandings of how detention regulation could improve health and safety – in detention and society. RECEDE will be developed through a multidisciplinary research programme, linking criminology, law, geography and citizen participation studies. My research will create new knowledge about the four fundamental components of the model: i) regulation of the system of interdependent detention institutions, within and across glocal geographical scales, by (quasi-)statutory bodies and by ii) (participatory) voluntary sector organisations. iii) relationships between detention regulation, law and policy ‘on the books’ and ‘bottom up’ norm making in the cells. and iv) the brokerage of innovation in detention regulation and practice. Each component addresses a significant gap in scholarship, which has thus far been constrained by intra- and interdisciplinary silos. RECEDE is informed by actor-network theory (ANT), a sociological method for examining organisation and agency. ANT sensitises researchers to complex realities that might otherwise have remained obscure. ANT has been little used within penology and holds unrealised potential to investigate and reconfigure detention regulation and practice, across local to global scales."
iManage,Rethinking Employment Law for a world of Algorithmic Management,"Amidst important debates about the gig economy and the automation of jobs, employment law has paid scant attention to the rise of algorithmic management: the increasingly pervasive reliance on monitoring technology and sophisticated algorithms to measure, control, and sanction workers. This poses a fundamental threat to the legal regulation of our labour markets. Automated management allows the exercise of hitherto impossibly granular employer control. At the same time, however, the absence of clear decisions and traditional management structures appears to disperse responsibility ‘into the cloud’. How can employment law respond to a world in which automation has not replaced workers—but their bosses? This pioneering project will develop the first systematic account of the challenges and potential of algorithmic management, examine its implications for legal regulation, and develop concrete solutions to avoid harmful path-dependencies. It tackles a risky challenge that goes right to the core of employment law’s existing structures, with technology developing at unprecedented and unpredictable scale. Looking at a range of jurisdictions across the European Union and beyond, iMANAGE requires the development of novel, interdisciplinary methodology at the intersection of data science and employment law. In articulating the underlying structures of automated management control, it develops a new and positive role for employment law in ensuring algorithmic accountability, and shaping the responsible use of technology in the workplace. This is a challenge we cannot shy away from: both the theoretical foundations of employment law, and its practical operation across different jurisdictions, depend on understanding and regulating the radically different organisation of the workplace of tomorrow."
GlobalCORRIDOR,"Urbanization, everyday life and techno-social differentiation","The pattern of contemporary, global urbanization is shifting. New geographies are being produced, with uncertain consequences for urban inequality. Vital here is surging investments into New Transnational Trade Routes through planning/operation of infrastructural corridors that cut across cities and regions, demarcating the futures of hundreds of millions of urban dwellers. Through deployment of advanced technologies, premium networks and high-tech enclaves’ corridors are transforming everyday urban life. However, there is little research interrogating the ways billions of Euros of investment into corridors transform the urbanization process nor how such processes might reinforce or address existing, or shape new trajectories of urban inequality, understood as techno-social differentiation. GlobalCORRIDOR will address these critical gaps by focusing on the everyday ways in which infrastructural life is now being produced, operated, experienced and navigated across corridors. This is advanced firstly, by assessing the global, urban geography/selected history of corridors (Objective 1). Second it explores the everyday assembling of Corridor Urbanization across three case study corridors (spanning the Mediterranean, North/East Africa, South Asia) (Objective 2). Third, it investigates everyday experiences of Corridor Urbanization within/outside selected enclaved spaces in order to understand the unequal ways in which infrastructure is experienced through access/costs/reliability/technology type (Objective 3). Fourth, it explains the global futures of corridors in reshaping the urbanization process in order to set a new agenda for research (Objective 4). Through generating an interdisciplinary, international programme of comparative research and the first comprehensive study of the corridor phenomena GlobalCORRIDOR will contribute to urban, geographical and technological studies, opening new ideas how we understand urbanization, infrastructure and inequality"
DEPART,The ‘de-party-politicization’ of Europe’s political elites. How the rise of technocrats and political outsiders transforms representative democracy.,"How do people reach the highest echelons of politics? Traditionally, the answer has been through political parties. Yet recently, more and more politicians in Europe take office with little or no party socialization. Technocrats and political outsiders have assumed power across Europe. Even established parties appoint ever more nonpartisans as ministers. Yet we still know nothing about how this ‘de-party-politicization’ of our political elites affects – or even damages – representative democracy. To address this gap, DEPART’s theoretical innovation is to re-conceptualize the idea of ‘party control of government’. Existing work views party control as established once parties appoint individuals to office. DEPART abandons this formalistic perspective and conceives of party control as a function of the socialization of political elites into parties. The weaker this socialization, the weaker the linkage that parties provide between voters and governments. Empirically, DEPART breaks new ground by developing the first biography-based measures of party control, using the most comprehensive and most granular analysis of political careers in Europe to date (~10,000 ministers, 30 countries, 1945–2020). It also employs survey experiments to study voter responses to de-party-politicization. With these unique data, DEPART addresses two hitherto overlooked questions. First, does de-party-politicization diminish the influence of the party composition of governments on policy outcomes? This would undermine the ability of voters to affect policy through their electoral choice. Second, do weak (or absent) partisan ties among political elites reduce the ability of voters to correctly assign blame for bad government performance? This would increase the chance that parties pay no electoral price for corruption, scandals and mismanagement."
DeVOTE,"The meanings of ‘voting’ for ordinary citizens, their causes and consequences","On Election Day, citizens are usually asked to vote by placing a mark besides one party and/or candidate on a ballot paper. What meanings do citizens attribute to that mark? Frequently it is assumed that citizens share the view that the mark is substantively meaningful. Yet high rates of abstention, rejection of politics as usual, distrust in election administration and integrity, and democratic backsliding now challenge this assumption. This project aims not only to provide first-time evidence on what ‘voting’ means for ordinary citizens, but also to examine variation in such meanings between individuals and across types of democracies. study how elections create and modify these meanings. and investigate their attitudinal and behavioural consequences. ‘Meaning’, in this project, refers to both the significance of voting for citizens as well as what is meant by voting for citizens, which may encompass citizen definitions or understandings of voting and/or the motivations they have for voting or not. Looking at what voting means for citizens in a variety of countries promises to provide a ground-breaking understanding of citizen-conceptualizations of representation and the psychology of voting that can challenge conventional wisdom about participation and voting as well as lead to practical implications for how elections are run and administered. In addition, the project agenda will result in an observatory devised for systematic data collection on the meanings of elections on Election Day. In the long run, this will provide a resource containing information about the political meanings given to elections by citizens themselves and can be used as a basis to refine and challenge the constructed interpretations commonly assigned to elections by the media and politicians. Citizen views are gathered via a novel approach based on a citizen-science website and inductive reasoning combined with panel data, vignette experiments and topic modelling to test causal mechanisms."
BACKLASH,Climate Backlash: Contentious Reactions to Policy Action,"Growing calls for ambitious climate change action are challenging for governance because such action can trigger backlash. Why do societies sometimes accept costly public good action, but at other times push back suddenly and reject it? Abrupt and impactful reactions to climate policy actions are increasingly witnessed: Climate Backlash. Examples include the Yellow Vests in France, and acrimonious policy rollbacks in Canada and Australia. Climate change governance theory is, so far, unable to account for such dynamics, which undermines prospects for ambitious climate action. The challenge of BACKLASH is to empirically study, and ultimately to theorise, this type of contentious reaction to policy action. The aim of BACKLASH is to explain why, how, and under which conditions climate backlash emerges in advanced industrial democracies. BACKLASH will: 1) Identify the configurational drivers of climate backlash across varying national contexts, 2) Determine the mechanisms and processes by which climate backlash occurs within specific national contexts, 3) Establish whether and how climate backlash diffuses within and between countries, and 4) Explain the forms (i.e. institutionalised, non-institutionalised) and variation of climate backlash across contexts. To accomplish this, BACKLASH will conduct a two-level study of 36 OECD countries, and 4 in-depth national cases of climate policy, namely Australia, Canada, France, United Kingdom. BACKLASH is ground-breaking in: 1) pioneering an original interdisciplinary lens for studying climate backlash, 2) advancing an ambitious mixed-methods research design, and applying and testing new innovations in cross-case analysis, and 3) tackling a new combination of challenging empirical circumstances confronting the field of climate governance with profound implications for policy-society dynamics. This will open up new frontiers for the interdisciplinary study of backlash to policy in addressing contentious collective problems."
CoChina,"Collaborative Planning in China: Authoritarian Institutions, New Media, Power Relations, and Public Spheres","Collaborative planning has become an effective means to address conflicts of interest in urban renewal and environmental management in China. However, the egalitarian principles that ground collaborative planning theory call into question its validity in China. The theory emphasizes consensus building in which various stakeholders come together for dialogue to address controversial issues. It rests on three assumptions: democratic institutions, neutral power and communicative rationality. These assumptions, which are often debated in the Western context, should clearly be questioned in the Chinese context, due to authoritarian institutions and the challenging nature of power relations. Therefore, the aim of my project is to examine the practices of collaborative planning in China and identify the challenges to the assumptions of the theory. I will develop three novel tracks for examination and reconceptualization. The first will analyze how Chinese political and planning systems, social capital and culture affect the interactive processes. The second will apply network theory and social network analysis to analyze various types of power relations between government, planners, civil society and citizens. The third will identify various forms of online public spheres and how they interact with offline public spheres to affect communicative and agonistic approaches to collaborative planning. The research will employ an innovative mixed methods approach combining critical discourse analysis, data mining, computer-assisted content analysis, and social network analysis to research a wide range of case studies. My project will lead to a new understanding of collaborative planning in China, and a reconceptualization of the collaborative planning theory to make it suitable for authoritarian contexts."
ProblemShifting,"Problem-Shifting between International Environmental Treaty Regimes: Causes, Consequences, and Solutions","International environmental treaties (e.g., Paris Agreement) are designed to solve specific environmental problems. Yet their potentially negative impact on environmental issues other than their own is rarely studied. Until now global governance theories have assumed that environmental treaties are inherently ‘green’, and hence, any adverse consequences are conveniently set aside as unintended or inevitable. But is that true? Here I question, do environmental treaties ever pursue their objectives by merely shifting problems to others? If so, when and why? Does such buck-passing create any systemic risk beyond those directly affected? And what might be appropriate responses to ensure our efforts add up to a net positive impact? Environmental problem-shifting, or protecting one part of the environment by damaging another, is a major dilemma arising in global governance. Yet the issue remains under-investigated, requiring an urgent scientific inquiry. PROBLEMSHIFTING will thus examine the causes and consequences of, and provide solutions to, environmental problem-shifting between international environmental treaty regimes. By drawing on my interdisciplinary and multi-method expertise in 'earth system' law and governance, I will (1) identify and explain conditions under which problem-shifting occurs. (2) assess and predict systemic effects of problem-shifting. and (3) offer solutions for optimizing the currently fragmented governance system. The project aims to advance the theoretical debate on the architecture of global governance and its overall effectiveness. The scientific breakthrough will be enabled through methodologically innovative combinations of qualitative and quantitative methods, including process tracing, comparative case studies, network analysis, system dynamics modelling, and multi-stakeholder workshops. Building on the theoretical and empirical foundations, I promise unique insights and valuable advice to markedly improve global governance decisions."
CURIAE VIRIDES,How the third wave of global judicial (and social) activism is filling ecological governance gaps and challenging the liability-remedy paradigm.,"This project conceptualises the worldwide progressive transformation of human rights litigation into more ecocentric litigation and the emerging but important role of (activist) courts in addressing ecological governance gaps. In addition, it will inquire how this greening of social litigation challenges the legal concept of attribution of liability in transnational lawsuits and influences access to effective remedy for victims of transnational ecological harms. The main hypothesis is that ecocentric lawsuits mostly seek to nudge the choice architects of ecological governance, i.e. policymakers and global value chain (GVCs) coordinating firms, to implement effective actions for the sustainability of ecosystems while not necessarily seeking concrete remedies for victims. Although the effectiveness of this activism could be questioned by considering that only a minority of transnational ecological conflicts become lawsuits, ecocentric case law has nevertheless the ability to nudge ecologically responsible behaviour of policymakers and firms. The project will inquire how this instrumentalist use of the judiciary may hide the necessary debate on the quality of ecocentric case law as courts lack technical knowledge on ecological and economic issues and on the type of remedies actual or potential victims (e.g. future generations) can obtain from ecocentric judgments. The combination of systematic (quantitative and qualitative) empirical analysis of global data should lead to a high gain project that sheds light on the transformation of social claims, on the synergies among social and judicial activism and soft law production and implementation, on the institutional quality of courts to understand global ecological and economic conflicts, on the patterns of innovative ecocentric case law, on whether triggering courts contributes to filling ecological governance gaps, and on whether this has (or not) a waterfall effect on access to remedy for victims of ecological harm."
DANGER,"Democracy, Anger & Elite Responses","This project is about the elite coalition strategies that will avoid democratic failure and deconsolidation – the loss of legitimacy among its elites and citizens. It will answer the question of which government coalitions help to avoid democratic deconsolidation, and ultimately democratic breakdown. It will do so by investigating the fate of democracies in interwar Europe, the best available comparison cases for contemporary democracies, and derive precise recommendations for policy-makers today. Presently, democracy is under threat around the world. Citizens disenchanted by economic inequality and migration are losing faith in democratic regimes. Populist parties and extremists at both ends of the political spectrum threaten democratic actors, institutions, and norms throughout the Western world. Yet few if any democracies today have failed outright, and this project adopts a historical-comparative approach and investigates the fate of 24 interwar democracies in Europe. The project makes five central contributions that move it beyond the current state of the art in political science. First, it innovates conceptually by investigating democratic deconsolidation, the loss of legitimacy among democracy’s elites and citizens, and democratic survival. Second, it innovates theoretically by developing a theory of strategic interdependencies between prodemocracy and antidemocracy political actors against the backdrop of citizen anger. Third, it innovates empirically by collecting new data on government coalitions and elite power grabs as well as citizen protests and political violence events. Fourth, it innovates methodologically by combining the strengths of quantitative, qualitative, and causal inference methods to investigate the effect of coalition governments with and without antidemocracy elites on democratic deconsolidation. Fifth, it innovates in terms of impact by matching historical to contemporary cases to derive lessons for today’s decision-makers."
DigitalGovernance,Governing with Data: Local Experimentation in Authoritarian China,"As new information technologies and the advent of “big data” are reshaping societies around the globe, inquiries into the nature and varieties of digital governance and their consequences become increasingly urgent. “Smart cities” are mushrooming particularly quickly in China, which is home to more than half of the more than 1,000 smart cities worldwide. These city governments have begun to experiment with digital technologies to harness the power of big data analytics for governing society. Emerging practices have momentous implications for the organisation of social, political and economic life in China and globally. A systematic study has yet to address the lacking empirical and conceptual understanding of digitalising governance practices in authoritarian China. The project seizes a unique opportunity to witness “natural experiments” of digital government modes as they emerge from China’s advanced smart cities. A political economy framework and policy cycle analysis will be used to study the interplay between government, businesses and citizens in local decision-making as digital technologies are increasingly integrated into the process. Through mixed-method, the project will achieve three objectives: 1. Study the variation in local digital governance modes and understand why these modes evolved in different ways. 2. Explore the mechanisms through which digital technologies are integrated into local decision-making processes and governance structures. 3. Assess the impacts of new digital governance modes for citizens, businesses and the state. Findings will generate new empirical data, on the basis of which it will be possible to push the conceptualisation of emerging digital governance modes and the assessment of their benefits and risks. The project will significantly add to the field of digital governance in authoritarian states and will contribute to debates reaching beyond the China context about societal change under advancing digitalisation."
MIDEBT,The Micro-foundations of Debt Crises,"This project takes a new bottom-up approach to understanding the political roots of government debt crises. It proposes that in order to understand why governments borrow excessively and experience crises, we must first understand what citizens are thinking (or not thinking) about debt policy. Citizens’ preferences are the cornerstone of political theories because they inform policymakers’ incentives. Yet, no studies have systematically examined why citizens in some countries are willing to take steps before a crisis to reduce government debt while others ignore warnings and reward political inaction. This proposal pursues two successive objectives. First, the project will conduct the first comprehensive analysis of individual-level preferences for debt reduction before a crisis. It will develop and test multiple hypotheses that seek to explain which elements of society are (un)supportive of debt reduction policies, what rational or irrational factors motivate their decisions, and how stable these preferences are to manipulation by elites. The analysis centers around original and innovative multi-country survey experiments that elicit the character and stability of preferences for debt reduction. The project’s second phase uses these insights to connect the micro to the macro. By understanding which groups of citizens are motivated by which material factors or cognitive biases, we will develop new theories explaining how the distribution of these groups, and their interaction with institutions, influence political decisions and ultimately affect the risk of sovereign debt crises. This analysis will include two empirical innovations. First, it will include the first ever survey experiment conducted on actual bond traders to determine which country political and economic factors are most important in assessing credit risk. Second, it will produce a new data set of government attempts to engage in debt reduction."
CIRCULAR X,Experimenting with Circular Service Business Models,"With increasing pressures on resources and the climate it is clear that a new business paradigm is needed. The Circular Economy has been heralded as a driver for sustainability and competitiveness. In contrast to the current linear economy, materials are kept at their highest utility at all times. Despite great policy, business and academic interest, knowledge on how to move to a Circular Economy is lacking. CIRCULAR X addresses a new and urgent issue in sustainability research: experimentation with circular service business models (CSBMs). Examples include companies shifting from selling to leasing products and introducing lifelong warrantees to extend product lifetimes. CSBMs are far from mainstream and experimentation focused on trialling new CSBMs is little understood. CIRCULAR X will develop a new field in sustainability studies: CSBM experimentation. It aims to conduct boundary-pushing and cross-sectoral interdisciplinary research in 3 continents and 5 countries – the Netherlands, UK, Sweden, China and USA - with 4 objectives: 1. Advancing understanding of CSBMs. their emergence and impacts 2. Advancing knowledge on CSBM experimentation 3. Developing CSBM experimentation tools 4. Designing and deploying CSBM experimentation labs CIRCULAR X will bridge and expand disparate knowledge on experimentation approaches across disciplines such as sustainability, design, business and entrepreneurship research. It will develop novel CSBM and experimentation concepts, catalogues, tools and labs by bridging these yet disparate fields. Through its comprehensive international approach, CIRCULAR X will deeply advance understandings on how CSBMs manifest themselves and how these can be experimented with, which will ultimately advance business activities towards a circular economy transition."
PROPERTY[IN]JUSTICE,"Land, Property and Spatial Justice in International Law","This project will scrutinize the concept, definition and interpretation of property rights in international law as they relate to land. It will not only examine the international human rights, environmental and cultural heritage law frameworks, but also specific areas of international economic law, including investment, that converge and diverge with spatial justice in the realm of land-based projects and policies. Lastly, the project will also include a strong conceptual component, by ascertaining to what extent a reconceptualization of property can contribute to transforming international law from ‘tool of empire’ to vehicle for change. Globalization has significantly affected the ways in which communities in many parts of the world interact with and access land and resources – from changing farming patterns due to international trade agreements, to collective tenure and customary rights in landscapes that are simultaneously the location of large-scale resource extraction projects. At the same time, normative developments in the field of human rights and environmental protection provide for the recognition of communities’ rights to ancestral and communal lands, as well as the free, prior and informed consent of communities in order to conduct activities on such lands (e.g. UNDRIP). Yet the abstract notion of ‘property’ rights in international investment law (land as commercial asset) often collides with the ‘lived-in’ property rights of people and communities on the ground (land as the basis for social, cultural and ecological life). As noted by Cotula, “far from being relegated to the exclusive domain of national law, property has long been and remains an important issue in international legal ordering” (2017, 234). Yet despite its centrality, its impact on people-place relations remains under-scrutinized in the international law scholarship. This project aims to fill this lacuna."
ATLANTIS,"Whales, waste and sea walnuts: incorporating human impacts on the marine ecosystem within life cycle impact assessment","The marine ecosystem covers around 70% of the planet. Today, every single part of this vast ecosystem is affected by at least one anthropogenic driver of change. This fact should cause us to pause and think: such a huge space, yet habitat and species loss are occurring at an unprecedented rate. The marine ecosystem provides us with a wealth of services and has an economic value exceeding 20 trillion US Dollars. In addition, the marine ecosystem is considered crucial for our sustainable future and is often regarded as the “next economic frontier”. However, despite its importance for humankind, the marine ecosystem is significantly underrepresented in sustainability research. We currently have no holistic approach to quantify the impacts caused by a large number of human pressures in the marine ecosystem. A powerful tool for identifying such impacts is life cycle assessment (LCA). LCA is the best available tool to assess potential environmental impacts of products and processes in a comprehensive way. However, methods have never been properly developed for including marine impacts in LCA results. I will contribute to closing this substantial research gap by developing novel models for quantifying impacts on ecosystem service losses (“whales”), as well as impacts of marine plastic debris (“waste”) and of marine invasive species (“sea walnuts”) within the LCA framework. These models will be developed based on impacts on species richness and ecosystem service potential. Including ecosystem services will be a paradigm extension and a substantial advancement for the LCA framework. All models will be tested in an overarching case study. Currently we are unable to determine whether planned marine activities and processes are sustainable. By developing these models, we will be able to do so with a holistic perspective. This is of unprecedented importance, if we want to manage this vital ecosystem in a sustainable way and preserve it for future generations."
ARCTIC,Air Transport as Information and Computation,"Air transport has by and large been studied as a transportation process, in which different elements, e.g. aircraft or passengers, move within the system. While intuitive, this approach entails several drawbacks, including the need for large-scale simulations, the reliance on real data, and the difficulty of extracting macro-scale conclusions from large quantities of micro- scale results. The lack of a better approach is in part responsible for our inability to fully understand delay propagation, one of the most important phenomena in air transport. ARCTIC proposes an ambitious program to change the conceptual framework used to analyse air transport, inspired by the way the brain is studied in neuroscience. It is based on understanding air transport as an information processing system, in which the movement of aircraft is merely a vehicle for information transfer. Airports then become computational units, receiving information from their neighbours through inbound flights under the form of delays. processing it in a potentially non-linear way. and redistributing the result to the system as outbound delays. In this proposal I show how, as already common in neuroscience, such computation can be made explicit by using a combination of information sciences and statistical physics techniques: from the detection of information movements through causality metrics, up to the representation of the resulting transfer structures through complex networks and their topological properties. The approach also entails important challenges, e.g. the definition of appropriate metrics or the translation of the obtained insights into implementable policies. In the main text of the proposal I present a number of preliminary results that point towards a radically new way of thinking about the dynamics of air transport. ARCTIC’s methodology will be used over the next five years to characterize and model delay propagation, as well as to limit its societal and economic impact."
Niche4NbS,Beyond assuming co-benefits in Nature-based Solutions: Applying the niche concept for optimizing social and ecological outcomes,"Urbanization is emerging as one of the major environmental global issues of the 21st century, with strong implications on the health of humans and natural ecosystems. Nature-based Solutions (NbS), broadly defined as cost-effective solutions that are inspired and supported by nature to simultaneously provide several environmental and social benefits, has shown promise in addressing this challenge. However, NbS implementation and assessments often rely on a one-size-fits-all approach, although interventions that maximize one benefit can have no influence on, or even negatively affect others. Furthermore, the current pathways from NbS to various benefits do not rely on a deep understanding of the underlying processes and functional relationships. As a result, the current use of NbS relies on broad targets that exhibit considerable risk of falling short of their objectives, eroding public support in their wake. This project will address these shortcomings by developing and demonstrating a widely applicable, theory-grounded, approach for understanding trade-offs and identifying optimal planning scenarios that maximize co-benefits. Using a mechanistic approach we will assess the effectiveness of NbS across domains in a way that allows mapping, upscaling and predicting NbS implementation outcomes. Innovative use of the ecological niche concept and a set of nature dose-response experiments will enable spatially-explicit multidimensional modelling of biodiversity and health and well-being measures. This will allow us to predict how NbS influence where species will be, and where people will be healthy and happy, equipping us with the tools to achieve coexistence of multiple benefits and social justice. Niche4NbS will demonstrate how to plan NbS that delivers co-benefits and provide planners with a robust tools to identify optimal planning solutions. Beyond the fundamental value Niche4NbS will push the European Commission along its path towards becoming a world leader in NbS."
State Silence,The Silence of States in International Law,"International law is the law between States. It is identified by observing the behaviour of States and deriving rules from their behaviour. But, what happens when States do nothing? Can States be bound by their own silence? Can international law develop through the silence of States? Can States be responsible for doing nothing? What happens when States do not appear before international courts and tribunals? These questions are immensely significant for States, international courts and tribunals, domestic courts, and individuals, who are all interested in knowing what the obligations of States are and how they can be enforced within and outside international courts and tribunals. Yet, there are major gaps in our understanding of the meaning of State silence and its legal effects. This project is the first comprehensive study of the silence of States in international law. It will explore and analyze whether the silence of States can bind them, and if so, under which circumstances. the role of State inaction for the responsibility of States. and the effect of State inaction in the field of international dispute settlement, focusing particularly on the proceedings before international courts and tribunals. It aims (a) to make a major contribution to knowledge on the meaning of silence by providing a comprehensive taxonomy of the ‘silences’ of States and on the legal effects of different ‘silences’. and (b) to critically analyse whether a change in the law may be called for. The project will conduct research in wide-ranging and geographically representative State practice available in the six official languages of the United Nations, international jurisprudence and literature. It will also employ empirical analysis of the reasoning of government officials’ and international judges in order to assess the advantages and disadvantages of States silence, in the form of non-appearance, in international judicial procedures."
EVaP,"Elections, Violence, and Parties","Since 1990, deadly violence has occurred in more than 30% of elections held outside of advanced, industrialized democracies. In the 2007 Kenyan elections and the 2010 Côte D’Ivoire elections, violence killed thousands of people in just a few months, undoing years of institution-building and undermining democracy. Much of contemporary politics unfolds in countries holding competitive elections but lacking institutionalized democracy. In these countries, election violence still happens routinely because politicians use violence to influence election outcomes in their favor. A major political and scholarly problem is that we know a lot about the conditions that make elections more or less violent, but lack insight into the more fundamental issues of how violence plays out on the ground. Departing from the focus on intensity in existing work, I develop a novel party-centered theory to explain the nature, organization, and consequences of election violence. Political parties are crucial actors linking politicians and citizens, and I attribute a central role to parties’ organizational and social links. The diversity of parties’ social support influences whether violence provides electoral benefits, implying that parties supported by a single group benefit more from violence. Party organization at the local level in turn explains whether groups can engage in targeted violence or have to rely on poorly-controlled thugs-for-hire. This theory changes how we think about election violence, explaining (1) how and why election violence happens and (2) the consequences of election violence for citizens. EVaP breaks new empirical ground by testing these claims subnationally in India and Nigeria, two of the world’s largest emerging democracies. EVaP uses a multi-method approach to examine within-country variation in party institutions, social support, and election violence in India and Nigeria, combining fieldwork interviews, quantitative data, survey experiments, and surveys."
N-EXTLAW,Law as Vehicle for Social Change: Mainstreaming Non-Extractive Economic Practices,"The current economic model is overdue for revision. The relentless focus on economic growth is ravaging the environment, and the concomitant social problems have either already reached glaring levels (rocketing global inequality) or seem poised to do so (climate displaced persons). A number of radical proposals, such as prosperity without growth, circular economy, or doughnut economics, have been proposed to chart a trajectory towards socio-ecological transformation, arguing that a profound change in our ways of living and modes of production is necessary in order to respond to the threats we face. Yet such proposals, however commendable, have gained only modest political traction, insofar as they seem unthinkable from the vantage point of our current economic system, consumption patterns, political discourse and legal institutions. This project will show how law can contribute to making such transformative projects politically credible. More specifically, it will demonstrate how law, and private law in particular, can be used to nurture those existing economic practices that already build on the environmental and social aspirations embodied by such projects. The two main objectives are, first, to offer a set of legal tools and policy proposals that would make the adoption of environmentally and socially non-extractive economic practices, such as social cooperatives or solidary financial institutions, more attractive for people to implement. Second, N-EXTLAW theorizes how law can turn seemingly utopian projects for socio-ecological transformation into a realistic legal-political project. By refashioning the concrete socio-legal arrangements for pursuing non-extractive economic practices as well as re-shaping the values on which economic decision-making draws, law can make non-extractive economic practices more present in everyday action, and thereby uphold those cultural frames that affirm the sense that socio-ecological transformation is within our reach."
Worlds of Lithium,A multi-sited and transnational study of transitions towards post-fossil fuel societies,"Worlds of Lithium is a multi-sited and transnational study that examines how the strategic replacement of fossil fuels with electric transport powered by lithium-ion batteries is taking place in Chile, the largest lithium producer worldwide, China, the world leader in lithium-ion battery production, and Norway, likely to become the world’s first ‘zero emission’ electric vehicle country. The overall research questions of the project are: How do planetary strategies to decarbonize transport act upon the landscapes and societies where a) lithium is extracted, b) turned into technology and c) used and potentially reused and recycled? How can the different ways in which these strategies take place inform non-destructive approaches to collaborative responsible actions to phase out fossil fuels—or decrease their utilization? Worlds of Lithium will innovatively answer these questions through a transnational documentation of the knowledges and practices through which scientists, grassroots communities, policy makers, and lithium-ion battery producers are differently responding to ecological transformations and disruptions at stake in transitions to sustainable societies. The project will explore such knowledges and practices with a special focus on the effects strategies to respond to global warming have on existing socio-economic and eco-political planetary inequalities. By studying how planetary efforts for decarbonizing transport trigger different processes in resource-making, the project will not only enrich the anthropology of natural resources, but it will also create ground-breaking conceptual tools to support, think, and document emerging collaborations for sustainability capable of powering planetary eco-responsibility. Thus, the project will innovatively theorize new imaginaries to think about what counts as sustainable transitions in times of enhanced ecological sensitivity."
SMOOTH,Sustainable finance for a smooth low-carbon transition,"The threat of climate change calls for a rapid transition to a low-carbon society. Aligning the financial system with climate stability is a crucial prerequisite for achieving decarbonisation while preserving economic prosperity and societal welfare. However, we currently lack a comprehensive understanding of how the institutional and behavioural features of financial systems may affect the speed and shape of the low-carbon transition. Additionally, the coevolving socioeconomic, financial and environmental repercussions of such a large-scale societal transformation have not yet been systematically analysed. The SMOOTH project will lay the foundations of an innovative macro-financial analytical framework to provide essential insights on the links between financial systems and decarbonisation dynamics. Methodologically, I will introduce a breakthrough by linking macroeconomic analysis with an original evidence-based representation of investment decisions based on forward-looking expectations of transition pathways. In the course of five years, this integrated modelling framework will enable the first comprehensive assessment of the transition financial drivers and obstacles, and their implications for growth, financial stability, employment, private/public debt and functional distribution, with a focus on Europe. Building on this knowledge, a harmonised set of policies aimed at achieving a rapid and smooth transition can be designed. I will go beyond the current state of the art by integrating the analysis of fiscal policies with monetary policies and financial regulation, and investigating their institutional requirements and implications. SMOOTH will create a new interdisciplinary field of research integrating elements from macroeconomic modelling, climate economics, behavioural finance, socio-technical transition theory and political science, lifting the analytical power of transition modelling to a new level and opening up novel avenues for future research."
2D4D,Disruptive Digitalization for Decarbonization,"By 2040, all major sectors of the European economy will be deeply digitalized. By then, the EU aims at reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 60% with respect to 1990 levels. Digitalization will affect decarbonization efforts because of its impacts on energy demand, employment, competitiveness, trade patterns and its distributional, behavioural and ethical implications. Yet, the policy debates around these two transformations are largely disjoint. The aim of the 2D4D project is ensure that the digital revolution acts as an enabler – and not as a barrier – for decarbonization. The project quantifies the decarbonization implications of three disruptive digitalization technologies in hard-to-decarbonize sectors: (1) Additive Manufacturing in industry, (2) Mobility-as-a-Service in transportation, and (3) Artificial Intelligence in buildings. The first objective of 2D4D is to generate a one-of-a-kind data collection to investigate the technical and socio-economic dynamics of these technologies, and how they may affect decarbonization narratives and scenarios. This will be achieved through several data collection methods, including desk research, surveys and expert elicitations. The second objective of 2D4D is to include digitalization dynamics in decarbonization narratives and pathways. On the one hand, this entails enhancing decarbonization narratives (specifically, the Shared Socio-economic Pathways) to describe digitalization dynamics. On the other hand, it requires improving the representation of sector-specific digitalization dynamics in Integrated Assessment Models, one of the main tools available to generate decarbonization pathways. The third objective of 2D4D is to identify no-regret, robust policy portfolios. These will be designed to ensure that digitalization unfolds in an inclusive, climate-beneficial way, and that decarbonization policies capitalize on digital technologies to support the energy transition."
FORESTDIET,Reinterpreting how forests support people's dietary quality in low-income countries,"Two billion people across the planet suffer from nutrient deficiencies. Dietary diversification is key to solving this problem, yet food security policy, especially in low-income countries, still focuses on increasing agricultural production and access to sufficient calories as the main solution. But calories are not all equal. Indeed, this approach has created a blind spot with respect to the role of forests, which are often overlooked but may be important for dietary diversification for the rural poor by providing wild foods, high-value products which can be sold and thereby enable food purchases, and fodder for livestock which then provide meat, milk and eggs as well as manure to improve agricultural production. This project will identify how forest loss and fragmentation affect people’s dietary quality. I will apply a cutting-edge multi-scale, multi-country, and data-rich approach. First, I will take a broad-scale perspective to explore where forest loss, forest fragmentation, and dietary changes are taking place and identify hotspots of forest change and deteriorating diets. To do so, I will spatially link publicly available household data on food consumption, with metrics on the proportion and spatial arrangement of forest from longitudinal datasets. Second, I will unravel the mechanisms linking forests and diets to develop a comprehensive framework on forest-diet linkages. Third, I will zoom in on selected sites in two countries and use in-depth fieldwork to elucidate causal relations between forests and dietary outcomes locally. The project will break new ground by providing the first generalizable empirical evidence of how and why forests influence dietary quality in low-income countries, thereby laying the ground for a shift in how we think about pathways to food security – that is, to move from conceptualizing food security as driven by agriculture alone to seeing it as dependent on socio-ecological interactions at the forest-agriculture nexus."
PolyCarbon,"Polycentric Carbon Pricing Governance: Cooperation, Contestation and Connectivity","The PolyCarbon project’s objective is to uncover, investigate and understand the underlying mechanisms and conditions for the expansion and contraction of the global system of carbon pricing governance. It will (1) chart the entire global system of carbon pricing policies, (2) explain the causes of adoption and rejection of (ambitious) carbon pricing policies, and (3) analyse the interaction amongst the various carbon pricing policies globally. The global system of carbon pricing policies will become exponentially more effective as it expands since carbon leakage is reduced. Carefully crafted and ambitious carbon pricing policies can be powerful tools for transitioning to a low-carbon economy in the urgent pursuit of international climate goals. Understanding the underlying mechanisms and conditions for the expansion and contraction of the global system of carbon pricing governance can provide insights for fast-tracking its formation. thus, accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy. The PolyCarbon project will develop a novel analytical framework that captures the complexity of local and transnational processes and their interaction. This framework will guide the creation of a unique and expansive database of carbon pricing policies. The database will be used for a comprehensive multi-method analysis, combining qualitative network analysis and case studies."
RESHUFFLE,RESHUFFLING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS LAW IN EUROPE,"Our continent is being shaken by a set of major challenges ranging from economic to security, refugee and rule of law crises. These events place unprecedented pressure on the institutional framework designed to hold Europe together since the second world war. The EU has emerged as the key player whenever the most fundamental rights of individuals are at stake. This is somewhat surprising. Since the 1950s, scientists have understood the European edifice as being based, on the one hand, on the Council of Europe designed to protect European values and fundamental rights in particular. and, on the other, on the EU intended to advance European (economic) integration. Therefore, it is the Council of Europe, an international organization distinct from the EU, that was initially placed at the forefront of fundamental rights protection. Yet, the EU is now taking the lead on setting fundamental rights standards. Benefits may be considerable where the EU offers strong institutional support. There may however also be a profound mismatch between the new function of the EU and its constitutional design. For instance, it may be inappropriate to address religious discrimination in employment – such as regulating the conditions for headscarf bans - through the same harmonization tools ensuring the free movement of goods. Are new concepts and legal tools needed to ensure trust in the EU system? The principal investigator, an EU constitutional and fundamental rights expert, will critically assess the shift in the nature of the EU’s contribution to European fundamental rights law with a view to better defining the new function of the EU in the field and making recommendations to improve its ability to perform such a function. For that purpose, she will draw on three aspects: legal research highlighting the main features of this stronger decision-making powers of the EU. theory of law informing the implications of the EU’s new quest for European values. and political and social science investigating the impact on stakeholders’ strategies."
BEYOND,Protection without Ratification? International Refugee Law beyond States Parties to the 1951 Refugee Convention,"Many of the world’s top refugee-hosting countries have neither signed nor ratified the 1951 Refugee Convention. So do international conventions make a difference? The Refugee Convention represents a paradigmatic – and exceptionally timely – test of this theoretical and empirical puzzle, for refugee protection is increasingly politicized and has wide-ranging implications for state sovereignty. The BEYOND project fundamentally reconsiders the impact of international refugee law by developing the first genuinely global and systematic theoretical framework for understanding the behaviour and position of states that have chosen not to sign the Refugee Convention – especially those that still accept the lion’s share of the world’s refugees. These non-party states, overlooked by scholarship and seen as ‘exceptions’ to the international refugee law regime, are at the core of this project rather than the margins. BEYOND asks: 1. What is the influence of the Refugee Convention in non-party states? 2. How do these non-party states engage with and help create the international refugee law regime? BEYOND exposes and analyzes the various ways non-party states relate to international refugee law. It brings an innovative combination of methods to bear, including case studies on 4 of the world’s top 7 refugee-hosting states–Turkey, Lebanon, Pakistan and Bangladesh. The sub-projects investigate BEYOND’s two basic hypotheses: 1. The Refugee Convention has a significant influence on the behaviour of non-party states. and 2. Non-party states engage with, and help shape developments within, international refugee law. BEYOND sheds crucial, empirically grounded light on the prevailing assumptions about whether and why non-party states are exceptional. It also advances our theoretical and scientific understanding of the complex effects of international conventions more generally."
ResilienceBuilding,"Social Resilience, Gendered Dynamics, and Local Peace in Protracted Conflicts","How can ‘resilient communities’ remain resilient in protracted conflicts and contribute to sustainable peace rather than to increased vulnerability to renewed conflict? How do local conflicts link to national conflicts and what are the implications for peacebuilding? What are the gender dimensions of social resilience? Is resilience always ‘a good thing’ or may it impede conflict resolution? This project pioneers an interdisciplinary research agenda into resilience building. The need for a greater analytical focus on the causes and consequences of social resilience is evident in the modest international record of peacebuilding and civilian protection. Scholarship increasingly invokes resilience terminology but lacks mature conceptual and empirical work. Building on the PI’s expertise in social resilience, communal conflict, and gender and peacebuilding, this project will establish an empirically-grounded research agenda on social resilience and sustainable peace. By providing a comparative analysis of resilience building and barriers to peace in Nigeria, South Sudan, the Central African Republic (CAR) and Kenya, the project will create a new agenda for resilience research that rests on novel conceptual development and interdisciplinary approaches to resilience combined with the systematic study of social resilience and local peace produced by an integrated team of specialist researchers. The project will involve a fieldwork-based multi-method research design that combines advanced quantitative techniques for assessing the consequences of international peacebuilding with regard to local peace and women’s empowerment with context-sensitive qualitative analysis of the often unintended consequences of social resilience and hidden barriers to local peace and changing gender relations. The project will result in a new scholarly community with a shared intellectual focus on social resilience and sustainable peace in protracted conflicts."
RadicalHOUSING,Radical Housing: Cities and the global fight against housing precarity,"According to UN-Habitat, each year millions of people face forced eviction from their homes, while a staggering 1.6 billion are inadequately housed. Forecasts suggest housing precarity will continue to grow in future, worldwide. In response, grassroots housing movements are becoming increasingly common. Crucially, these groups fight for more than just housing, often advancing critiques of wider societal inequalities. Yet little is known of the broader significance of these struggles, and research has failed to offer an understanding of geographically dispersed movements. The ways in which the fight for the right to housing operates is essential to understand contemporary urban life. RadicalHOUSING will fill these critical gaps through an innovative Radical Housing Approach and pioneering empirical research at a global scale. First, the project identifies the importance of a historical understanding of dwelling precarity, to appreciate the relevance of housing struggles worldwide (Objective I). Second, it investigates and profiles prominent grassroots networks in the Americas, Europe, Africa, and Asia to analyse their goals and organisational culture (Objective II). To appreciate the wider significance of radical housing resistance, the project deploys an ambitious ethnographic encounter with grassroots struggles in eight emblematic cities (Objective III). It then brings selected participants and experts together in a Global Forum of Radical Housing, fostering the exchange of peer-to-peer knowledge to generate further findings (Objective IV). Finally, the project will gather these insights into an innovative critical comparative framework, which will lead to agenda-setting publications, interventions, and academic scholarship (Objective V). RadicalHOUSING is a ground-breaking project that will contribute to housing, urban and geographical studies, as well as to grassroots knowledge, opening a new phase in understanding the global fight against housing precarity."
AUTONORMS,"Transforming Norms Research through Practices: Weaponised Artificial Intelligence, Norms, and Order","Weapons systems with an increasing number of autonomous features are emerging as revolutionary technologies of war. In particular, this concerns systems with autonomy in their critical functions that relate to selecting and engaging targets without human input. This weaponisation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) signals the looming absence of meaningful human control in warfare, which has become a central focus of the debate on autonomous weapons systems (AWS). Here, states either seek to introduce new norms governing AWS or to leave the field open in order to increase their room of manoeuvre. These uncertainties make monitoring to what extent AWS will shape and transform international norms governing the use of force a matter of great importance. But existing International Relations research on norms despite producing excellent critical work does not yet enable us to understand the dynamics of this vital process because it does not capture adequately how norms emerge and develop. The state of the art conceptually connects norms predominantly to international law and limits attention to how norms emerge in deliberative international forums. Instead, the AUTONORMS project will develop a new ground-breaking theoretical approach that allows us to study how norms, understood as standards of appropriateness, manifest and change in practices. Taking this bottom-up perspective, we will monitor norm emergence and change across four contexts of practices (military, transnational political, dual-use, and popular imagination) in four countries (USA, China, Japan, Russia). This flexible portrayal allows us to adequately understand how norms related to AWS will develop, as well as considering the impact such emerging norms have on the current international security order of which norms are constitutive building blocs. The project thus provides an innovative analytical model for studying uncertain processes of technological innovation associated with the AI revolution."
EMPOCI,"Governing sustainable energy-mobility transitions: multi-level policy mixes, transformative capacities and low-carbon innovations","In its recent 1.5°C report the IPCC stressed that global efforts to promote low-carbon transitions need to be accelerated to meet the Paris Agreement. This raises a number of questions for the emerging field of policy mixes for sustainability transitions, such as on the role of actors and multi-level governance in politically contested socio-technical transition processes. In this project, I aim to address these knowledge gaps by asking how low-carbon transitions in the increasingly interconnected energy and mobility systems as major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions can be accelerated. EMPOCI has three objectives: Objective 1: To provide a novel conceptual and empirical understanding of the global interplay between multi-level policy mixes and low-carbon innovations in socio-technical transitions which foregrounds the role of actors and transformative capacity. -> By bridging the innovation and policy studies literatures and comparatively analyzing the increasingly interconnected electricity-mobility-ICT systems in four key countries, EMPOCI will advance the research frontier on transformative policy mixes for low-carbon transitions. Objective 2: To develop and test widely applicable novel methodological tools enabling both deep and broad insights into the drivers and barriers in unfolding multi-sectoral transition processes towards sustainability. -> Drawing on a multi-method research design EMPOCI will provide novel standards for assessing policy, agency and innovation dynamics in politically contested low-carbon transition processes (e.g. survey, big data). Objective 3: To co-design practically relevant multi-actor strategies for accelerating sustainable energy-mobility transitions, thereby supporting the Paris Agreement in combating climate change. -> Based on EMPOCI's findings a transformative foresight process is organized with stakeholders from business, policy, academia and society to jointly derive implications for transformative policy mixes."
MOBI,Modern Bigness : Challenges for European Competition Law,"The influence of large tech-companies in society is undeniable. The emergence and development of the digital economy marks a paradigm-shift towards a more connected and fluid ‘platform society’. New challenges stem from rapid technological developments, the combination of economic and digital power, and arise from a combination of unprecedented data-collection and the indispensability of pivotal platforms for both market-participants and citizens. This impacts both markets and democracy. Even though the challenges are urgent, law struggles to find answers. This is true also for European competition law, which aims to combat the negative effects of market power. However, as is hypothesized here, powerful tech-companies give rise to a new type of power: ‘Modern Bigness’. It impacts both market values and non-market values, such as freedom and democracy. The MOBI project investigates whether European competition law can and should tackle the challenges of Modern Bigness, arising from the digital economy. It will first develop an original theory of ‘Modern Bigness’. A case study on hypernudging digital platform-users and autonomy, and a case study on access to platforms by using the essential facilities-doctrine or public utility theory will highlight the entwinedness of market and non-market impacts, while a third study evaluates whether the power of Modern Bigness itself could be under threat by the disruptive impact of blockchain-technology. The overarching research question is answered by considering the response to the question whether European competition should tackle the multifaceted challenges of Modern Bigness within a normative framework building upon European constitutional theory and the nascent field of technology regulation. The project fundamentally reconsiders the nature and boundaries of European competition law in relation to digital developments. Ultimately, it is driven by the desire to protect fundamental societal, market and non-market values."
POAB,The Psychology of Administrative Burden,"The burdens of dealing with administrative rules and red tape in government are a fact of life around the world, ranging from small hassles to heavy burdens in the form of stigmatizing processes of proving eligibility and facing potential sanctions. In light of the immense importance of such burdens for millions of people and for the effectiveness of benefit programs, we know surprisingly little about the conditions that give rise to experiences of burden. POAB combines and extends extant theory and uses a unique combination of experimental methods and data to explain how, why, and for whom administrative rules are experienced as burdensome. POAB studies comprehensive rules regarding unemployment and social benefits and will provide novel register, physiological, and survey measures of welfare benefit recipients’ experiences of burden. I develop and test three theories to explain differences in experiences of burden: 1) How resource scarcity causes cognitive load and hence reduces the ability to cope with rules. 2) How self-efficacy increases the ability to cope with rules. and 3) How perceptions of being undeserving cause stigma and stress. POAB analyses the causal impact of rules on burden. To this end, I use a unique combination of complementary experimental methods in political science: 1) Cross-national lab experiments with physiological measurement and manipulations of rules, scarcity, efficacy and deservingness perceptions. 2) Cross-national survey experiments to assess different aspects of rules in different contexts. 3) Quasi- and field experiments to assess the impact of rules on register measures of burdens in a real-world context. POAB offers a fundamentally new interdisciplinary approach by bridging the gap between research on administrative burdens and psychological perspectives. The project’s output will provide profound knowledge of citizens’ experiences of burden and the inequalities in such experiences among recipients of major welfare benefits."
RIVERS,"Water/human rights beyond the human? Indigenous water ontologies, plurilegal encounters and interlegal translation","RIVERS’s main challenge is to produce ground-breaking knowledge, from an empirical, interdisciplinary and dialoguing perspective, about the contentions and challenges intrinsic to reconceptualising human rights with different ways of understanding and relating to water. Worldwide, indigenous peoples are mobilising against the neoliberalisation of nature, demonstrating radically different ways of knowing, being and living. At the same time, in 2010 the UN acknowledged water as a human right, while in 2017 New Zealand, India and Colombia established ground-breaking legal precedents by granting rivers human rights. RIVERS’s overarching research question is: To what extent can international human rights law come to grips with plurilegal water realities? This project engages with one of the most pressing questions of this century: the relationship between humans and nature. RIVERS tackles two intertwined core objectives: 1) analysing different ways of knowing and relating to water and life among indigenous peoples and their understanding of its (potential) violation by extractive projects. 2) discussing the contributions, challenges and pitfalls of interlegal translation of differing water natures in plurilegal encounters at domestic and international levels. RIVERS will develop a multi-sited analysis and empirical case-studies in three contexts: Colombia, Nepal and the UN human rights protection system. Through the lens of legal pluralism, this will foreground competing political and legal water realities that interrogate dominant understandings of the modern world. RIVERS will address two interrelated research challenges: 1) indigenous visions/practices: beyond water as a natural resource and human right. 2) the UN human rights system: towards counter-hegemonic water knowledge production. This project will pioneer new ways of thinking about water beyond the modern divides of nature/culture, providing clues about future paths towards reconceptualising human rights."
TRANSJIHAD,Explaining Transnational Jihad - Patterns of Escalation and Containment,"TRANSJIHAD aims at advancing our understanding of one of the greatest contemporary challenges on the international agenda for peace and security, namely the ability of transnational jihadist movements to tap into local conflicts, hence escalating violence. TRANSJIHAD specifically investigates the questions of how jihadist conflicts become transnational and under what circumstances they can be contained. The project also aims at developing an interdisciplinary analytical framework, which combines micro- and macro level approaches to jihadism, drawing from both Religious Studies, Security Studies and Peace & Conflict Studies. Methodologically, TRANSJIHAD dissolves the scientific dichotomy between inside- and outside-oriented approaches to the study of transnational jihadist conflicts, widening prevailing scientific understandings of transnationalization processes. The project uniquely combines i) a quantitative examination of transnationalization processes drawing from the Religion and Armed Conflicts (RELAC) dataset based at Uppsala University, ii) comparative case studies of the mechanisms of escalation and de-escalation of jihadist conflicts across Asia, the Middle East, the Arab Peninsula and Africa focusing on the movements of Islamic State, Al-Qaeda, the Taleban, and Boko Haram, iii) securitization analyses of the macro-level conflict structures that transnational jihadist movements tap into, and finally iv) sociotheological worldview analyses of potential changes in jihadist conflict imagery during transnationalization processes. With its focus on macro-level conflict structures, TRANSJIHAD also contributes to developing a new framework for thinking about containment, providing an alternative to both the micro-level countering discourses embraced by much of the radicalization research, and the containment thinking that stems from the treatment of jihadist conflicts as civil wars in the peace and conflict literature."
CriticalMaaS,"Concepts, theories and models for planning , operating and evaluating the dynamics of Mobility as a Service","Online marketplaces enable in the travel context the dynamic matching of supply and demand. The shared economy can revolutionize urban mobility by blurring the traditional division between private and public transport, shifting from an ownership model to Mobility as a Service (MaaS). Existing transport models are designed with the premise that transport consists of either fully scheduled and controlled fleets or individual privately owned vehicles. Since MaaS breaks the conventional division between individual (ownership) and collective (usage) travel alternatives, existing theories and models of travel behaviour, transport network and operations cannot explain the behavioural dynamics, interactions and evolution of both supply-side and demand-side of the marketplace. This research program develops and tests theories and models of transport network in the domain of two-sided mobility market. CriticalMaaS will produce a set of new behavioural models of traveller and supplier choices in transport marketplace settings. The supply- and demand-side dynamics and their interactions will be mathematically formalized and developed in both network flow distribution and agent-based modelling frameworks designed for the analysis of their co-evolution. Models will be used to study emerging patterns, transition phases and critical mass concepts by testing the conditions required for generating economies of scale in market adoption and evolution of MaaS. Models will be estimated and validated using a series of surveys, choice experiments, laboratory experiments, observed behavioural data from on-demand services, focus groups and interviews. The proposed research efforts will result with several theoretical and methodological breakthroughs in the field of transport modelling. In addition, the research program will make methodological and empirical contributions to the field of travel behaviour as well as insights into the dynamics of a two-sided (mobility) marketplace."
WEIRD WITNESSES,Beyond WEIRD Witnesses: Eyewitness Memory in Cross-Cultural Contexts,"Our increasingly international society demands that eyewitnesses of serious crimes regularly provide testimony in cross-cultural settings, such as international criminal tribunals. This poses significant challenges for investigators and legal decision-makers. Errors in fact-finding may result in wrongful convictions and unjust acquittals. Yet, eyewitness memory research has predominantly focused on Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) witnesses. The project addresses two key objectives: (1) develop culturally modulated theory of eyewitness memory and (2) design and test evidence-based interview guidelines. In Subproject 1, I will examine what happens when police investigators interview eyewitnesses from a different cultural background. It will involve the systematic coding of culture-dependent variables in video-recorded police interviews with witnesses of serious crimes in South Africa, a society with many different subcultures. In Subproject 2, I will analyse the frequency, nature and legal consequences of culture-dependent variables in international criminal cases. It will involve an empirical document analysis of eyewitness evidence provided at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, and interviews with international legal scholars and practitioners. In Subproject 3, I will assess how different cultural groups encode, store and retrieve memories, and how memory reports are evaluated in immigration contexts. It will involve a series of experiments in which the objective and perceived characteristics of statements provided by asylum seekers originating from Sub-Saharan Africa are compared to a matched Western control group. The project integrates analyses of video, document and experimental data to provide insight into culture-dependent variables in eyewitness memory. The new theory will enable researchers and practitioners to steer away from the present WEIRD bias in legal psychology."
VictPart,Righting Victim Participation in Transitional Justice,"The question of how to serve justice, facilitate peaceful transitions and empower victims of past large-scale abuses is about as old as the field of transitional justice (TJ) itself. Increasingly, academics and practitioners are turning to participatory approaches as a promising way to make advances regarding these issues. An oft-cited benefit of victim participation in TJ processes is that it allegedly increases the legitimacy of these processes by rendering them more locally relevant, and that it empowers participants. However, little is known about how to organize this participation in practice or under which conditions alleged benefits (for individual victims-participants or for society at large) are likely to materialize. As a result, participation is often organized in an 'add-victims-and-stir' way, with little critical reflection about potential unforeseen or long-term effects. Because TJ processes often face significant practical, financial and political constraints, it is crucial to better understand how participatory approaches can be developed in ways that contribute to a positive and lasting legacy. The main objective of this project is therefore threefold, (1) to conduct a systematic analysis of the scope, nature, modalities and role of victim participation in transitional justice processes, (2) to study empirically and comparatively how participation shapes victims' experience and understandings of justice and their rights, and (3) to develop a critical victimology framework and establish how this framework can be used to conceptualize victim participation in ways that contribute to TJ's goal of engendering just, stable and secure societies. A multi-disciplinary approach, rooted in legal studies, social psychology, political science, public administration and anthropology is proposed, which allows for a multi-dimensional understanding of these issues, both in academic and in practical terms."
NestIOr,Who gets to live forever? Toward an Institutional Theory on the Decline and Death of International Organisations,"Many international organisations (IOs) are under significant pressure. The World Health Organization was heavily criticized over its handling of the Ebola outbreak. The United States has not contributed to the UNESCO budget since 2011 and plans to quit in 2018. The United Kingdom is negotiating its exit from the EU and Burundi left the International Criminal Court. The ultimate way for states to show their discontent is to disband IOs: no less than a third of the IOs, created between 1905 and 2005, has formally ceased to exist. While academics have analysed how IOs are designed and develop, we know virtually nothing about decline and death. This project addresses therefore the question why do IOs decline or die? The key innovation is to complete the theory on the 'life and death of IOs'. The main hypothesis is that some IOs, due to their specific institutional characteristics, are better at longevity than other IOs. Flexible IOs are more likely to live longer, because they can adjust and be more responsive to external pressures, such as wars, reduced trade volumes or political turnover in the member states. Larger IOs are also more likely to live longer, as it will be more difficult for states to replace them with other IOs. They may also be in a better position to fight off external pressures, including from the membership. This project uses a mixed methods approach. Through an innovative survival analysis, it analyses the effect of institutional characteristics on the likelihood that IOs decline or die as a result of external pressures. This requires the compilation of a new dataset. The quantitative analysis is complemented with fine-grained case studies of IOs at risk of declining and dying across different policy areas. These case studies are informed by unique data resulting from interviews."
LORAX,The Lorax Project: Understanding Ecosystemic Politics,"The Lorax project is a comparative effort to expand our understanding of global political architecture through the consideration of a potential set of ‘missing cases’, namely supranational policy fields organized around regional ecosystems. The project explores this question: Do regional politics around national border-crossing ecosystems share important resemblances and differ in significant ways from global politics? To address this question, the Lorax project analyzes the networks of actors, hierarchies between actors and diplomatic norms of the governance fields that have grown up around efforts to ‘speak for’ border-crossing ecosystems in three locations – the Arctic Ocean, the Amazon Basin, and the Caspian Sea. ‘Ecosystemic politics’ is meant to indicate regional-level political efforts justified by the shared management or discussion of collectively acknowledged ‘border-crossing’ ecosystems. Frequently, the political cooperation may be on issues that would be seen as environmental or regulatory politics relating to the ecosystem itself, but ecosystemic politics is not, by definition, limited to such questions of environmental politics. Rather, the word ‘ecosystemic’ gives the Lorax team a sense of where to look without presupposing the interests and issues that engaged actors may bring to those regional interactions. The project aims to generate new insights about the architecture and dynamics of global governance by rigorously researching and then comparing three cases of policy fields around national border-crossing ecosystems. The team will consist of the PI, a postdoc, a PhD and additional senior researcher capacity as needed. An ambitious, but achievable, publication plan (9 articles, 1 book) is mapped out to ensure rigorous finalization of results and dissemination to social science fields engaged with supranational governance questions."
COSMOLOCALISM,"Design Global, Manufacture Local: Assessing the Practices, Innovation, and Sustainability Potential of an Emerging Mode of Production","COSMOLOCALISM will document, analyse, test, evaluate, and create awareness about an emerging mode of production, based on the confluence of the digital commons (e.g. open knowledge and design) with local manufacturing and automation technologies (from 3D printing and CNC machines to low-tech tools and crafts). This convergence could catalyse the transition to new inclusive and circular productive models, such as the “design global, manufacture local” (DGML) model. DGML describes the processes through which design is developed as a global digital commons, whereas the manufacturing takes place locally, through shared infrastructures and with local biophysical conditions in mind. DGML seems to form economies of scope that promote sustainability and open innovation while celebrating new ways of cooperation. However, such claims rest on thin conceptual and empirical foundations. COSMOLOCALISM is a multiphase, pilot-driven investigation of the DGML phenomenon that seeks to understand relevant organisational models, their evolution, and their broader political economy/ecology and policy implications. Through the lens of diverse case studies and participatory action research, the conditions under which the DGML model thrives will be explored. COSMOLOCALISM has three concurrent streams: practices. innovation. and sustainability. First, DGML practices will be studied, patterns will be recognised and their form, function, cultural values, and governance structure will be determined. Second, the relevant open innovation ecosystems and their potential to reorient design and manufacturing practices will be examined. Third, selected DGML products will be evaluated from an environmental sustainability perspective, involving both qualitative and quantitative methods. The interdisciplinary nature of COSMOLOCALISM will explore new horizons to substantively improve our understanding of how we could do “more” and “better” with less."
LINKS,Kick-starting global cLimate Investments: uncovering hidden liNks in climate finance and exploring dynamic evolution of investment networKs for policy deSign,"LINKS aims to contribute to a transformation of the climate finance system to deliver the scale and quality of investment needed to meet the Paris climate goals and ensure effective capital allocation. By understanding the architecture of the financial system, exploring macro patterns in low-carbon investment emerging from observed investors’ behaviour and interactions, and designing cross-cutting policies aligned with long-term climate targets, LINKS will promote essential guidance for a re-orientation of financial flows towards low-carbon and energy efficiency investments. LINKS aims to advance the understanding of the role of climate finance to foster the low-carbon transition by using network theory, advanced computational techniques and extensive empirical data to model the financial system as a complex adaptive system. LINKS will thus lay the foundations of, and pioneer a new field, namely climate finance networks, where dynamics of interconnected investors represented as a network, results in the complex behavior of the whole system. LINKS will bring together interdisciplinary theories and developments in finance, environmental economics, sociology, computer science, network analysis and complexity in an integrated approach to study and model climate finance. Taking this approach will allow advancements in at least three directions: i) a new theoretical approach to account for complexity thinking and systemic perspective in climate finance, ii) more empirical analyses on networks structures of low-carbon investments and their dynamics to shape the development of the climate finance system, iii) policy modelling analyses to explore whether specific architectures of the climate finance system have significant impact on the effectiveness of climate public policies and invested public resources. LINKS will thus deliver robust conclusions on how the financial system could contribute to the required investments to achieve the low-carbon transition."
CALENDARS,Co-production of seasonal representations for adaptive institutions,"Climate change may be undermining the stock of seasonal representations that society draws on to understand and live according to the weather. The CALENDARS project studies how modern society represents seasons, and how these representations shape institutions and help people live with seasonal change. The project opens an important emerging field in climate adaptation research by examining the representations of ‘normal’ seasons underlying key institutions, assesses their quality for successful adaptation to rapid climate change, and analyses facilitators and barriers to adopting representations more flexibly to new climates. It contributes a novel perspective on how to transform our institutions – from schools to farmer cooperatives – from the foundational culture and representations up, to better fit the changing seasonal cycles we are experiencing. CALENDARS empirically explores the relationship between different institutions’ ideas of seasons and their successful adaptation through an in-depth comparative study of a set of institutions in two local communities, in Norway and New Zealand. It is steered by an overall objective to: ‘Advance knowledge and understanding of how seasonal representations shape and are shaped by institutions, and critically appraise the quality of these representations for contributing to successful adaptation to seasonal change’. Conceptually, CALENDARS looks at representations as continuously ‘co-produced’ at the boundary of nature and society, and society and institutions. It tests a novel reconceptualisation of co-production as a prism. with each of the project’s three phases looking at the complex processes by which representations emerge through different ‘lenses’ of co-production. Methodologically, the project tests the feasibility of a novel basket of bespoke methods spanning narrative interviews, calendar boundary objects and collaborative sustainability science."
CONSULTATIONEFFECTS,"Effects of stakeholder consultations on inputs, processes and outcomes of executive policymaking","Consultations with stakeholders (citizens and interest organizations) are frequently used by executive bureaucracies to design policies and formulate legislation. National ministries, regulatory agencies and the European Commission employ a variety of consultation designs that combine different practices - public consultations, public hearings, workshops, expert groups, advisory committees. Consultations are key to European economic growth strategies such as the Lisbon Agenda and Europe 2020. Despite their near ubiquitous use and legitimising rhetoric, there is currently no systematic analysis assessing empirically the assumption that stakeholders’ participation in policymaking via consultations improves policymaking and results in better outcomes and more legitimate governance. This project aims to address this gap and to systematically investigate and explain the effects of stakeholder consultation designs on policy inputs, processes and outcomes of executive policymaking in 29 political systems: all 28 EU Member States and the EU polity. The project pioneers a path-breaking conceptualisation of consultation designs as representative institutions similar to electoral systems. They play a key instrumental role in the institutional balance of power and constitute a new source of bureaucratic reputation, autonomy and power. The project elaborates an original theory explaining consultation effects on policymaking that accounts for the intrinsic challenges of democratising twenty-first century bureaucracies, and the inherent trade-offs of democratic and technocratic policymaking. Empirically, the project breaks new ground by designing an ambitious data collection strategy aimed to construct an unprecedented, cross-national, comparative dataset on stakeholder consultation designs and characteristics of inputs, processes, outputs and outcomes observed at policy proposal level, across policy areas and political systems."
BIT-ACT,Bottom-up initiatives and anti-corruption technologies: how citizens use ICTs to fight corruption,"Corruption is a global challenge that affects the lives of millions of citizens. In the past decade, Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have become indispensable tools in the fight to reduce corruption, especially when employed from the bottom-up by civil society organizations. While pioneering initiatives in this direction have flourished, to date we only have unsystematic and descriptive evidence regarding how they work and the associated consequences. With the objective of significantly advancing knowledge on this topic, BIT-ACT will open a new line of inquiry by investigating what I call anti-corruption technologies (ACTs) to: (1) assess how civil society organizations engage with ACTs to counter corruption, (2) appraise how ACTs enable intersections between bottom-up and top-down efforts against corruption, and (3) evaluate how ACTs blend with the transnational dimension in the struggle against corruption. Based on an interdisciplinary framework that combines corruption studies, science and technology studies and social movement studies, BIT-ACT will use the constructivist grounded theory method to analyze a combination of textual and visual data in a comparative and transnational research design including nine countries – Algeria, Bangladesh, Brazil, Estonia, India, Italy, Spain, Ukraine, Uruguay. BIT-ACT will be groundbreaking in three ways. At the theoretical level, it will expand the debate on anti-corruption providing grounded concepts and models to explain ACTs. at the empirical level, it will advance knowledge on how the usage of ACTs is changing the relationship between citizens and democratic institutions. at the methodological level, it will innovate in the use of grounded theory assessing a new standard for cross-national comparative grounded theory. Finally, BIT-ACT will produce sound and useful knowledge for the stakeholders involved in the fight against corruption worldwide by suggesting how to best employ ICTs from the bottom-up."
FIDELIO,Forecasting social Impacts of bioDiversity consErvation poLicies In EurOpe,"Designating Protected Areas (PAs) is the most important policy tool for biodiversity conservation. Over 100 new PAs have been established in the past 36 months in European Union territory. However, effective management of PAs is often obstructed by conflicts mainly associated with the social impacts (SIs) imposed on local communities by their establishment. Despite the importance of these SIs there are certain aspects in this field that remain significantly under-researched. There is now an increasing need to incorporate SI assessments in decision making processes by providing a clear framework explaining how perceptions of these impacts are created and predicting their change in the future. This will support the achievement of international goals for biodiversity conservation and adaptation to climate change as well as better accounting for social justice issues for communities dependent on protected natural resources. The aim of FIDELIO is to develop for the first time a new paradigm in order to understand how perceptions of SIs are formulated taking into consideration the dimensions of space and time. FIDELIO will assist in increasing public engagement and the incorporation of local opinions in decision-making. It will also facilitate the process of policy development and a reduction in conflicts between different stakeholders in PAs. FIDELIO will last 5 years and its research objectives will be explored through the application of a mixed-methods approach including the implementation of two rounds of social surveys in 4 PAs across Europe and the testing of the framework in 15 additional PAs. This is an extremely timely project considering the steady increase of new PAs and the re-designation of current ones. FIDELIO will contribute to the better understanding of SIs and facilitate predictions for their change in the future, while assisting in maximizing social benefits for local communities arising from the designation of a PA."
IMAGINE,"Geographical imaginations and the (geo)politics of volcanic risk: cultures, knowledges, actions","Volcanoes can be cultural symbols, a source of fear, of fascination and of scientific study and a practical problem for civil protection: they involve complex social, cultural and political dynamics, and often have multi-scalar, trans-border impacts. Yet the management of volcanic risk tends to be strongly dependent on uncertain information from physical scientists about volcanic activity, with social scientific studies concentrating on social vulnerability and communication, and there is a relative dearth of studies that address the cultural and (geo)political contexts of scientific knowledge production in particular places. Geographers have explored the role of “geographical imaginations” in scientific discourses in other fields such as climate change: people, including scientists, imagine the social and physical landscapes around them. This project seeks to combine science studies, human geography and disaster risk reduction to provide a holistic approach to volcanic risk, and inform ongoing discussions about scientific advice in disasters more broadly, through a consideration of the geographical imaginations of scientists and populations. It focuses on understanding volcanic and disaster risk as a consequence of complex interactions and relationships between landscape, community, science and politics that blur the boundaries between society and nature. It combines methods from the social and physical sciences in Latin America and East Africa to investigate: (i) the ways in which scientists and people who live on volcanoes interpret and live with their environment. (ii) the interaction of national authorities with these modes of living, and how national borders affect them. (iii) the power dynamics of warnings within these contexts and across them. (iv) the implications of this approach for disaster risk reduction more broadly. Outcomes will include two books, several sets of scientific papers and three international meetings."
HRNUDGE,A NUDGE IN THE RIGHTS DIRECTION? REDESIGNING THE ARCHITECTURE OF HUMAN RIGHTS REMEDIES,"Recent years have seen a renewed interest in the effectiveness of human rights law and judgments, yet almost no attention has been given to the impact of remedies on states’ compliance practices or the internalisation of human rights into their domestic legal systems. Through a combination of quantitative and qualitative research in six countries, the project aims to expose the dynamics of the (non)compliant state and the efficacy of different types of remedies in changing the behaviour of human rights violators. These goals will be achieved through three sub-studies: (1) an empirical study of the case law of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) to determine the compliance and internalisation practices and their link to different remedies. (2) the exploration and analysis of states’ internalisation practices and policies (including the identification of players that shape this practice) to determine whether remedies play a crucial role in shifting states’ actions. (3) a computer simulation to discover how we can change the architecture of human rights remedies to increase compliance and internalisation, and to deter future violations. The central aim of the project is to identify new remedy options – incentives or nudges – which human rights institutions can use to deter future violations. Using the example of the ECtHR and its caselaw, the research will build on insights from behavioural economics to interrogate widespread assumptions about monetisation of human rights, public shaming, and deference shown to states in the specification of remedies. Through computer simulation, the project will aim to predict how monetary and non-monetary remedies could be used separately or together to alter the behaviour of states and their key players. The research will be ground-breaking in many ways, reshaping the field of human rights remedies and contributing crucially to the emerging field of behavioural international law."
IMAGINE,"EUROPEAN CONSTITUTIONAL IMAGINARIES: UTOPIAS, IDEOLOGIES AND THE OTHER","While scholars have presented and promoted a series of specific theories of EU constitutionalism, no one has yet attempted to analyse their wider intellectual context and the relationship among them – what we call here ‘European constitutional imaginaries’ (ECIs). In addition, IMAGINE does not limit this general analysis to the mainstream thinkers writing for the audience located at the supranational/transnational level. It includes the perspective of thinkers writing in particular EU member states. IMAGINE seeks to uncover whether there are individuals and ideas that have made important, yet often overlooked, contributions to ECIs. Crucially, IMAGINE puts emphasis on post-communist Europe’ experience, hitherto mostly ignored in EU constitutional scholarship. As a result, IMAGINE will provide the first-ever synthesis and critical evaluation of the core theories of EU constitutionalism, theorizing their mutual relationship and the way in which they have influenced each other. The overarching objective is to provide a novel account of ECIs: one informed by their intellectual history, which comprises both Old and the post-communist Europe, and which seeks to understand the various problems that lead some people to reject EU constitutionalism and its core values, seeing them as mere utopias or oppressing ideologies. IMAGINE employs an innovative combination of research methods: empirical surveys, citation network analyses and elite in-depth interviews, together with traditional legal analysis. It will involve experts from particular member states though a number of workshops and a conference organized by the IMAGINE Team. The PI is uniquely placed to realise IMAGINE: now based as a Professor of EU law at an elite socio-legal research centre iCourts (University of Copenhagen), he has participated in EU constitutional discourse both as a scholar and practitioner in one of the member states of post-communist Europe for more than 10 years."
JustSites,The Global Sites of International Criminal Justice,"JustSites studies the multitude of localities in which international criminal justice is produced, received and has impact. Building an innovative scientific vocabulary, the project understands these justice sites to be social topographies in which the political, legal and professional activities that collectively create international criminal justice are developed. The justice sites include locations in which forensic exhumations are carried out, NGO offices in conflict zones, foreign ministries, private law firms, media outlets, academic research centers, and the international criminal courts. These sites are closely related, and all depend on and compete with each other to define the direction of international criminal justice. With its analysis of justice sites, the project moves beyond the conventional focus on courts and their context to investigate instead the balances of authority and power that affect the relations between these topographies and thus drive the development of international criminal justice as a field of law. To investigate the relational topography of justice sites, the multidisciplinary project analyzes how these sites produce international criminal justice ideas and practices, and how such ideas and practices are received and have impact in other sites. By following the impact of ideas and practices as they move from one site to another, the relative and perceived authority and power of these sites will be identified and analyzed. Through their productive and receptive character, the justice sites also communicate the results of international criminal justice to broader audiences, labelling them in the process as a success or a failure. Therefore, contributing the first investigation of the topography of justice sites is not only of significant value as frontier research, but is crucial for understanding the wider societal, legal and political impact of this field of law."
ImagiDem,Imagi(ni)ng Democracy: European youth becoming citizens by visual participation,"The current political and institutional crises render the future of European democracy uncertain. To gain deeper insights into what the current discontent may lead to, and how to address it for the good of an equal and inclusive democracy, we have to study future political actors, today’s young citizens, and examine what are the means of political action prevalent to them. The public sphere of today’s youth is increasingly dominated by visual content, and therefore the visual dimension of political participation is to be a key concern in research thereof. The current youth’s understanding of political action – building arguments, mobilizing, and participating – is likely to become firmly anchored in repertoires of visual participation. ImagiDem will explore, analyze, and conceptualize visual participation of young European citizens in order to formulate a model of democratic practices in the 2020s. ImagiDem addresses visual political participation and democratic practices among young citizens in the European context using a radical triple-strategy: it combines visual ethnography with computational big data minining and analysis, and deploys this combination to a comparative research setting. The project design includes four countries of comparison – Finland, France, Germany, and Portugal – with both an ethnographic and a computational subproject realized in each of them. Both methodological approaches – comparative online ethnography, and computational, machine learning based analysis of large sets of social media image data – are risky and hitherto scarcely explored. The theoretical challenge ImagiDem takes is to develop pragmatist theorizing of visual justification and engagements on the one hand, and visual cultural toolkits and frames, on the other. With this methodologico-theoretical toolkit, ImagiDem provides overarching analysis of the future of European democracy."
WILDTRADE,Quantifying the global patterns and trends of the illegal wildlife trade: from artificial intelligence to financial market analysis,"Illegal wildlife trade is one of the major threats driving the global extinction crisis. Despite political will to halt the problem, the magnitude and scale of illegal wildlife trade have been relatively poorly studied compared to other threats affecting biodiversity conservation. Lack of data and complexities in determining illegal trade volumes and the availability of illegal wildlife products in the marketplace have thus far limited progress in research. The socio-ecological and economic drivers underlying the illegal wildlife trade remain unclear. The goal of this project is, for the first time with this extent and detail, to quantify global patterns and trends of the illegal wildlife trade and how market forces shape them. The deluge of information from digital technologies in the ‘Information Age’ combined with the development of new artificial intelligence techniques will allow me to quantify the global patterns and trends of the illegal wildlife trade at an unprecedented spatio-temporal detail. Illegal wildlife trade is booming online and I hypothesize that Big Data mined from social media platforms can help identify which wildlife products are traded and to assess motivations behind the trade. I plan to combine such novel, geotagged and temporally accurate, information with other spatio-temporal datasets on law enforcement and human pressure, to identify the global hotspots under pressure from illegal wildlife trade and quantify the flow of wildlife products between these hotspots and the marketplaces in demand countries. I also plan to investigate how pervasive market forces underline the global patterns and trends of the illegal wildlife trade. The proposed research will provide (i) novel concepts and methods for conservation science and identify (ii) species and areas most under pressure from illegal wildlife trade globally, (iii) the trade routes and flow of wildlife products. and (iv) the drivers underlying the illegal wildlife trade."
BROKEX,Brokering China’s Extraversion: An Ethnographic Analysis of Transnational Arbitration,"Chinese global engagements are deepening across sectors and geographic regions. The objective of BROKEX is to fill specific gaps in knowledge about how China’s extraversion advances. The project takes an original approach by examining brokers who mediate in transnational fields. It opens the “black box” of China’s global integration by moving beyond descriptions of input and output characteristics to elucidate underlying dynamics. The objective will be achieved in two phases. First, the PI and two postdoctoral researchers will carry out ethnographic case studies in the Pearl River Delta, South China, that yield complementary information on the common challenge of brokering across geographic scales: * Connecting low-cost Chinese manufacturing with African markets. * Integrating Chinese academic research with global scientific communities. * Transnational architecture production. The diverse cases offer insights into the mechanisms of brokerage across distinctive sectors. In the second step, we build on the empirical findings and literature to develop brokerage theory. Social scientific research on brokerage commonly uses the morphology of social networks as its starting point, and focuses on how actors positioned at the intersection between groups operate. BROKEX adopts an innovative approach by examining how actors strategically seek to shape network morphologies in order to bridge gaps between groups. By directing theoretical attention towards relationship formation that precedes acts of brokerage, this line of inquiry advances understandings of how and why brokered connections emerge. Ethnographic case studies combined with critical theorization will generate new knowledge about the processes beneath the “rise of China” ─ one of the most consequential socioeconomic developments of our times."
CLD,"China, Law, and Development","The world is in the midst of a sea change in approaches to development. The rise of nationalist politics in the U.S., U.K. and Europe have questioned commitments to global governance at the same time that China has emerged as a champion of globalization, a turn of geo-political events that would have been unfathomable ten years ago. Through its own multi-lateral institutions, China is setting a new agenda for development from Europe to Oceania. China’s approach differs from Anglo/Euro/American approaches to “law and development” (LD). Whereas LD orthodoxy has sought to improve legal institutions in poor states, Chinese do not foster rule of law abroad. Instead, Chinese view law as one set of rules, among others, to facilitate economic transactions and not to foster democratization. This distinction has sparked a global debate about the so-called “China model” as an alternative to LD. Yet there is little empirical data with which to assess the means and ends of China’s expanded footprint, a question with long-term implications for much of the developing world. This project addresses that problem by proposing that even if Chinese cross-border development does not operate through transparent rules, it nonetheless has its own notion of order. The project adopts a multi-sited, mixed method, and interdisciplinary approach—at the intersection of comparative law, developmental studies, and legal anthropology—to understand the nature of China’s order. The project has two objectives: 1. To establish the conceptual bases for the study of China’s approach to law and development by developing the first systematic study of the impacts of Chinese investment on the legal systems of developing economies. 2. To experiment with a comparative research design to theorize how China’s approach suggests a type of order that extends through a conjuncture of regional and local processes and manifests itself differently in diverse contexts."
LO-ACT,Low Carbon Action in Ordinary Cities,"The challenge of LO-ACT is to enable low carbon urban development in medium and small cities in rapidly urbanising areas in East, Central and West Africa, South Asia and South East Asia. The majority of emissions in the next century will be emitted by infrastructures that are yet to be built, particularly in rapidly urbanising areas where infrastructure is lacking. Population forecasts suggest that most population growth will take place in small and medium cities. Yet, to date, research on climate action has focused on showcasing strongly branded, successful initiatives in global cities. The low carbon transition depends on myriad of actions in ordinary cities, that is, cities outside global networks of climate innovation and leadership. LO-ACT will address this critical gap by delivering the first multi-dimensional, large scale assessment of low carbon action in ordinary cities. It will contribute a new framework to understand global environmental politics and urban governance. First, LO-ACT will analyse the imaginaries of local action that have shaped global environmental politics over 30 years (Objective 1). The work programme will also analyse the mobility of low carbon urban policies in transport, energy, and housing across different urban contexts (Objective 2). LO-ACT will deliver a comparative analysis of urban trajectories in 113 ordinary cities, and five in-depth ethnographic case studies (Objective 3). Finally, it will provide a critical assessment of governance theory and a revised framework to acknowledge the messy and ordinary contexts of urban action (Objective 4). LO-ACT will bring together an interdisciplinary, international team of researchers, an international network of academic advisors, and four regional hubs that will support context-specific data collection and analysis. The research will contribute to the fields of human geography, urban studies, environmental politics, sustainability transitions and science and technology studies."
MARIPOLDATA,The Politics of Marine Biodiversity Data: Global and National Policies and Practices of Monitoring the Oceans,"In order to protect marine biodiversity and ensure that benefits are equally shared, the UN General Assembly has decided to develop a new legally binding treaty under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Marine biodiversity data will play a central role: Firstly, in supporting intergovernmental efforts to identify, protect and monitor marine biodiversity. Secondly, in informing governments interested in particular aspects of marine biodiversity, including its economic use and its contribution to biosecurity. In examining how this data are represented and used, this project will create a novel understanding of the materiality of science-policy interrelations and identify new forms of power in global environmental politics as well as develop the methodologies to do so. This is crucial, because the capacities to develop and use data infrastructures are unequally distributed among countries and global initiatives for data sharing are significantly challenged by conflicting perceptions of who benefits from marine biodiversity research. Despite broad recognition of these challenges within natural science communities the political aspects of marine biodiversity data remain understudied. Academic debates tend to neglect the role of international politics in legitimising and authorising scientific concepts, data sources and criteria and how this influences national monitoring priorities. The central objective of MARIPOLDATA is to overcome these shortcomings by developing and applying a new multiscale methodology for grounding the analysis of science-policy interrelations in empirical research. An interdisciplinary team, led by the PI, will collect and analyse data across different policy-levels and spatial scales by combining 1) ethnographic studies at intergovernmental negotiation sites with 2) a comparative analysis of national biodiversity monitoring policies and practices and 3) bibliometric and social network analyses and oral history interviews for mapping marine biodiversity science."
QuAnGIS,Question-based Analysis of Geographic Information with Semantic Queries,"In the age of big data, geographic information has become a central means for data scientists of various disciplines to embed their analysis into a spatio-temporal context, from human mobility patterns and social inequality to the investigation of personal health. However, as the variety of data sources available on the Web increases, it becomes more and more impossible to comprehend and utilize all tools available to answer geo-analytical questions. The variety of formats and syntaxes required by Geographic Information System (GIS) toolboxes or statistical packages divides the research community into various tool expert groups. Hence, whenever a functionality is needed but not available in one tool, analysts are forced to reformulate their questions in terms of the technicalities of another tool. Furthermore, new tools are difficult to learn, and translations cause severe interoperability problems. Finally, this procedure does not scale with the increasing variety of analytic resources on the Web, preventing analysts from tapping its full potential, and making the promise of seamless big data analytics a mere distant dream. Consider, in contrast, how easy it is for a user of a digital smartphone assistant such as Amazon's Alexa to ask a question like What is the weather today? and get back an answer from the Web. It would mean a tremendous breakthrough in information science if analysts could similarly ask familiar questions in order to get the tools and data required to answer them. Unfortunately, analytic technology currently cannot handle such questions. To realize this vision, it is necessary to understand how analytic resources can be captured with the questions they answer. In this project, I will develop a novel theory of interrogative spatial concepts to turn geo-analytical questions into a machine-readable form using semantic queries. In this form, questions can directly be matched with the capacity of major analytic GIS tools and data on the Web."
UNMAKING,Societal transformation to sustainability through the unmaking of capitalism? A comparative study of radical grassroots innovations in Europe,"Modern capitalist societies engage destructively with the natural environment. Societal transformation to sustainability is urged, but it implies a degree of disruption of modern, capitalist ways of being and doing. Radical grassroots innovations – those that posit a profound cultural, economic, and political transformation of dominant institutions and practices - hold the potential to lead such transformation, but may be constrained by their marginal, local, small-scale character. This programme aims to understand to what extent, under what conditions, and through what processes radical grassroots innovations unmake modern, capitalist institutions and practices. This research will compare Italian and German radical grassroots innovations in agriculture to: (1) identify and categorize mechanisms of unmaking that are involved in radical grassroots innovations. (2) explain whether and how unmaking creates space for alternatives from the individual to the social-ecological level. (3) understand how mechanisms of unmaking at different levels interplay. (4) explain why unmaking may result in different outcomes in different context. (5) develop a theory of unmaking in societal transformation to sustainability.This research is ground breaking as it (1) approaches societal transformation from the perspective of unmaking of dominant institutions, rather than of the introduction of innovations, (2) mobilizes theories that have so far not been considered, and innovatively integrates theories and levels of analysis, (3) originally employs mixed methods that capture trajectories of change, and enable to generalize causal mechanisms in complex social-ecological systems. This programme will push the boundaries of our understanding of transformation to sustainability. It will generate scientific knowledge that will be relevant across the social sciences, offer a theoretical lens –unmaking-, and test a process-tracing methodological approach to stimulate interdisciplinary research."
ConHuB,Resolving the links between poverty and rule-breaking in a conservation context,"Poverty is frequently perceived to be the root cause of illegal natural resource use – the hunting or extraction of wildlife not sanctioned by the state. When unsustainable, such activities threaten conservation of ecosystems and endangered species. However, understanding what motivates individuals involved is a major challenge. understandably few are willing to discuss their motives for fear of punishment [1]. Furthermore, severe, multifaceted poverty overlaps with regions prioritised for their globally important biodiversity [2]. This association exacerbates the problem that illegal activities pose for policy-makers responsible for managing and policing the use of nature. The dominant approach to conserving biodiversity is to establish protected areas [3] which typically restrict resource use and manage infractions through law enforcement [4]. However, the designation of such areas does not guarantee compliance, as demonstrated by ongoing infractions [5] and its conspicuous profile on global policy agendas. This includes the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development which calls for urgent action to halt biodiversity loss and hunting of protected species [6]. Solving this problematic cocktail of poverty, exclusion from resources and drivers of illegal resource use requires a new approach to understanding why people break rules and to what extent poverty underpins behaviour. Recent advances in cutting-edge techniques for asking sensitive questions are paving the way towards a more accurate understanding of the prevalence and drivers of illegal acts [7]. Combining conservation social science with development studies, criminology and social psychology, this project will examine, for the 1st time, the relative importance of multidimensional poverty and socio-psychological characteristics in dictating people’s involvement in illegal resource use which will be contextualised by histories of national park establishment and how the idea of illegality shifts through time."
POWDER,"Protest and Order. Democratic theory, contentious politics, and the changing shape of western democracies","The research project aims to analyze the interrelationship between protest and political order under the contextual conditions of the changing shape of modern western democracy. Two groups of ques-tions are connected to this study perspective, which will be answered by means of a democratic-theoretically-led synchronous comparison of selected contemporary protest movements – anonymous digi-tal protest movements, transnationally organized alter-globalization protest movements, the No Border movement and the rightwing identitarian protest movement: The aim is to clarify firstly (1) the extent to which the new forms of protest question the premises of democratic orders, what potential for further de-velopment lies within the new forms of protest on the one hand, and what are the challenges to democracy on the other. Secondly, the aim is to determine (2) the influence and relevance held by the democratic order itself in an age of the changing shape of democracy with regard to the specific formation of the new forms of protest, and what statements can be made on how the formation of the order is changed, in turn, by the new forms of protest themselves. In order to achieve these study perspectives, POWDER consists of an overarching democratic-theoretical framework project (TFP) and four empirical subprojects (SP 1-4), which each analyze one of the protest movements mentioned in the context of a qualitative approach (documentary analysis, participatory observation, qualitative interviews). The comparison of these protest movements investigates (I) recurring patterns, but also contrasting assessments with regard to the interre-lationship between the political order and the protest movements, examines at a second level (II) the dif-ferent manners in which the new forms of protest challenge democratic-theoretical dimensions, and at-tempts at the third level (III) to reconstruct a general democratic-theoretical determination of meaning of present-day protest movements."
FAIRFISH,"Hidden Hunger, Forgotten Food","Food Security is a grand challenge of our time, but three factors inhibit our ability to meet global targets. First, interdisciplinary approaches incorporating ecological, social, and health sciences are fundamental, but lacking. Second, a disproportionate focus on food quantity overlooks ‘hidden hunger’, or micronutrient deficiencies, which are implicated in over a million deaths annually. Third, small-scale fisheries (SSF) reach 100s of millions of people in the developing world, hold potential for achieving food security, but remain ‘forgotten food’ in global discourse. Consequently, an interdisciplinary approach that tackles hidden hunger within SSF is a critical frontier for food security research. Fish are particularly high in many micronutrients, but a systematic understanding of which species have the greatest concentrations of key nutrients is needed. Inadequate access to nutritious food is one of the most significant problems of the modern age, which can be illuminated through analyses of power. The failure to realise the tremendous potential for improving food security through fisheries stems from a lack of understanding of how social drivers exacerbate or ameliorate nutritional inequalities. Consequently, an in-depth analysis that quantifies how key social drivers impact nutritional inequality, is essential. FAIRFISH will address these gaps to uncover the ecological and socio-cultural determinants of the contributions SSF make to human health: 1. Establish the ecological and environmental determinants of nutrient availability among fish species using a traits based approach. 2. Advance social practice theory, by integrating an analysis of power, to determine what power relations enable or constrain access to nutritious food. 3. Progress interdisciplinary science, by integrating findings from 1 and 2, to quantify the impact of key social drivers on nutritional inequality, and uncover opportunities to meet nutritional needs."
GLOBTAXGOV,A New Model of Global Governance in International Tax Law Making,"The overall aim of this research project is to assess the feasibility and legitimacy of the current model of global tax governance and the role of the OECD and EU in international tax lawmaking. Unlike the former OECD projects that only provide for exchange of information between countries, in the BEPS Project, the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive, the EU state aid investigations and the EU External Strategy, the OECD and the EU focus on substantive issues that when implemented will change the international tax architecture of developed and developing countries. These initiatives aim to ensure that governments engage in fair competition and that multinationals pay their fair share. Even though these objectives are legitimate, these developments raise the questions what is the role of the OECD and the EU in global tax governance? and under what conditions can the model of global tax governance be feasible and legitimate for both developed and developing countries? These initiatives have generated tensions between developed and developed countries and between EU and third (non-EU) countries. The tensions between countries call for the articulation of a new framework of global tax governance that is legitimate and based on considerations of fairness for all countries participating. Against this background, my project will first assess the feasibility of the legal transplant of the BEPS minimum standards into the tax systems of 12 countries of research by asking three sub-questions (i) why are these countries participating in the BEPS Project? (ii) how will the BEPS minimum standards be transplanted into the tax system of these countries? and (iii) how can the differences in tax systems and tax cultures of these countries influence the content of these minimum standards? Thereafter, the conditions for the legitimacy of the role of the OECD and the EU will be provided in light of the theories of legitimacy and governance."
SWFsEUROPE,"Legitimacy, Financialization, and Varieties of Capitalism: Understanding Sovereign Wealth Funds in Europe","The number and size of sovereign wealth funds (SWF) has grown substantially in the last decade, leading to an unsettled debate regarding their legitimacy in the global political economy. Some suggest they represent the (re)emergence of state-led capitalism subject to geopolitical motivations that threaten free markets. For others, SWFs represent a source of long-term patient capital capable of mitigating market short-termism. Either way, SWFs challenge the norm, particularly in the West, that financial markets are spaces of exchange for non-state actors. In three complementary and interdisciplinary work programmes the SWFsEUROPE project will explain the evolving and variegated pattern of ‘sovereign fund capitalism’ in Europe, developing a new theory of the relationship between states and global finance. First, the project breaks new ground by explaining and theorizing how the legitimacy of SWFs as commercially oriented investors is performed when they are still entities of the state. No study has critically examined how legitimacy is performed via mechanisms such as the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds and the Santiago Principles, or the growing evidence of collaboration with cognate institutional investors (e.g. pension funds). Second, this projects seeks a multi-layered explanation of the uneven pattern of investment flows and stocks of foreign SWFs into European countries through hypothesis testing of aggregate investment data with different theories of national-institutional variety, coupled with a comparative analysis of the bilateral investment-promotion relationships of investment-receiving countries. Third, the project will compare the growth and development of European SWFs. There is no comparative study exploring why some states are sponsors of an SWF (e.g. Italy, France, Ireland) and others are not (e.g. UK), what the motivations are and how they are made legitimate."
NUCLEAR,Nuclear Weapons Choices Governing vulnerabilities between past and future,"Nuclear weapons choices commit populations and societies for decades and can wipe them out in matters of minutes. How is the scope of available nuclear weapons choices decided? Direct experience cannot be the answer as no one can rely on personal experience of nuclear war. Most decision-makers no longer even have the experience of the effects of such weapons either given that North Korea has been the only country testing nuclear weapons since 1998. The populations’ wishes do not qualify either, since they are very rarely consulted and only few studies on those attitudes exist. Therefore this project offers the first in depth global investigation of the grounds on which the scope of publicly acceptable nuclear weapons choices have been based since the end of nuclear testing. To do so, this project constructs an interdisciplinary research program about responsibility in an age of nuclear vulnerabilities. It investigates four ways in which nuclear weapons choices are bounded: 1) the intellectual categories we depend on to think about those issues. 2) the governance of nuclear knowledge by nuclear-weapons related institutions. 3) specific readings of the past identifying events or trends from which lessons are expected to be learned about the scope of the possible, and 4) the imaginary of possible futures as opposed to the ones deemed utopian. Combining archival research and interviews worldwide, with large-scale polling and discourse analysis of policy officials and strategists over several decades, it assesses the blinding power of categories created several decades ago and sometimes still deemed as irreplaceable lexicon of the nuclear age as well as the way in which nuclear weapons programs modify the governance of knowledge. Based on those findings, it offers a renewed notion of responsibility in the nuclear age built on full awareness of nuclear vulnerabilities in their epistemic and political dimensions, and not only the material ones."
GLOBESCAPE,Enabling transformation: Linking design and land system science to foster place-making in peri-urban landscapes under increasing globalization,"Unprecedented urbanization is threatening landscape diversity, bringing along new social and environmental problems. Standardized business centers, single family residential areas and shopping malls displace highly productive agricultural land, while the culture and lifestyles of local communities become absorbed into the sphere of globalization. This dramatic uniformisation is nurtured by the ever increasing global human migration. People are losing their sense of place and their motivation to initiate change. Uniformed international landscapes start dominating peri-urban areas. The result is a tremendous increase in fragility of these new landscapes of the twenty-first century, calling for an active and creative landscape shaping process to secure the long-term provision of critical ecosystem services. Up until now, however, models and tools developed in land system science have not caught up with the needs to understand and ultimately foster humans’ capacities to shape their landscapes. This project will contribute to a next generation of tools and methods to foster the development of resilient landscapes. I suggest linking design and probabilistic modeling in a collaborative landscape development tool to enable the transformation of spaces into places. This unconventional approach is necessary to deal with the probabilistic nature of landscapes. Landscapes can only be defined by including the observer – a concept severally neglected in today’s research efforts. Anchored in four peri-urban case studies, the interdisciplinary experimental and modeling work will have impact far beyond predicting transformation pathways of peri-urban landscapes under increased globalization. The resulting methods and tool will redefine the status quo of current geodesign tools, promote novel ways of deliberative decision-making and governance, and ultimately support humans to intentionally transform peri-urban landscapes."
HumanTrafficking,Human Trafficking: A Labor Perspective,"This project conducts a theoretical, methodological, and normative paradigm shift in the research and analysis of human trafficking, one of the most pressing moral and political challenges of our times. It moves away from the currently predominant approach to trafficking, which focuses on criminal law, border control, and human rights, towards a labor-based approach that targets the structure of labor markets that are prone to severely exploitative labor practices. This shift represents an essential development both in the research of migratory labor practices and in the process of designing more effective, and more just, anti-trafficking measures, that are context-sensitive as well as cognizant to global legal and economic trends. The project will include four main parts: 1) Theoretical: articulating and justifying the proposed shift on trafficking from individual rights and culpabilities to structural labor market realities. 2) Case-studies: conducting a multidisciplinary study of a series of innovative case studies, in which the labor context emerges as a significant factor in the trafficking nexus – bilateral agreements on migration, national regulations of labor standards and recruiters, unionization, and voluntary corporate codes of conduct. The case studies analysis employs the labor paradigm in elucidating the structural conditions that underlie trafficking, reveal a thus-far mostly unrecognized and under-theorized set of anti-trafficking tools. 3) Clinical Laboratory: collaborating with TAUs Workers' Rights clinic to create a legal laboratory in which the potential and limits of the tools examined in the case studies will be tested. 4) Normative: assessing the success of existing strategies and expanding on them to devise innovative tools for a just, practicable, and effective anti-trafficking policy, that can reach significantly more individuals vulnerable to trafficking, by providing them with legal mechanisms for avoiding and resisting exploitation."
DATAJUSTICE,Global data justice in the era of big data: toward an inclusive framing of informational rights and freedoms,"The increasing adoption of digital technologies worldwide creates data flows from places and populations that were previously digitally invisible. The resulting ‘data revolution’ is hailed as a transformative tool for human and economic development. Yet the revolution is primarily a technical one: the power to monitor, sort and intervene is not yet connected to a social justice agenda, nor have the organisations involved addressed the discriminatory potential of data technologies. Instead, the assumption is that the power to visualise and monitor will inevitably benefit the poor and marginalised. This research proposes that a conceptualisation of data justice is necessary to determine ethical paths through a datafying world. Its two main aims are: first, to provide the first critical assessment of the case for, and the obstacles to, data justice as an overall framework for data technologies’ design and governance. Second, to present a conceptual framework for data justice, refining it through public debate. The project will develop an interdisciplinary approach integrating critical data studies with development studies and legal philosophy. Using Sen's Capabilities Approach, it will conceptualise data justice along three dimensions of freedoms: (in)visibility, digital (dis)engagement, and nondiscrimination. Multi-sited ethnography in combination with digital methods will be used to build a conceptual framework, which will then be tested and shaped by debates held in nine locations worldwide. The research is groundbreaking in terms of 1) its use of the Capabilities Approach to address the social impacts of data technologies. 2) its integrative approach to problems previously addressed by the fields of law, informatics and development studies, and 3) its aim to reconcile negative with positive technologically-enabled freedoms, integrating data privacy, nondiscrimination and non-use of data technologies into the same framework as representation and access to data."
CCLAD,The Politics of Climate Change Loss and Damage,"The way in which normative principles (“norms”) matter in world politics is now a key area of international relations research. Yet we have limited understanding of why some norms emerge and gain traction globally whereas others do not. The politics of loss and damage related to climate change offers a paradigm case for studying the emergence of - and contestation over - norms, specifically justice norms. The parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have recently acknowledged that there is an urgent need to address the inevitable, irreversible consequences of climate change. Yet within this highly contested policy area - which includes work on disaster risk reduction. non-economic losses (e.g. loss of sovereignty). finance and climate-related migration - there is little consensus about what loss and damage policy means or what it requires of the global community, of states and of the (current and future) victims of climate change. Relying on an interdisciplinary theoretical approach and an ethnographic methodology that traverses scales of governance, my project - The Politics of Climate Change Loss and Damage (CCLAD) - will elucidate the conditions under which a norm is likely to become hegemonic, influential, contested or reversed by introducing a new understanding of the fluid nature of norm-content. I argue that norms are partly constituted through the practices of policy-making and implementation at the international and national level. The research will examine the micro-politics of the international negotiations and implementation of loss and damage policy and also involves cross-national comparative research on domestic loss and damage policy practices. Bringing these two streams of work together will allow me to show how and why policy practices shape the evolution of climate justice norms. CCLAD will also make an important methodological contribution through the development of political ethnography and “practice-tracing” methods."
POLEMIC,Politics and Emotions Investigated Comparatively,"Many claim that politicians make more, and more extreme, emotional appeals than ever before, because these appeals win over the emotional citizen. With highly emotive language people like Donald Trump, Geert Wilders or Marine Le Pen are pounding on the portals to power. Do such emotional appeals affect citizens’ political choices? Yes, they can. But, citizens’ existing emotional attachments to parties, leaders or issues moderate the success of emotional appeals. POLEMIC will extend existing theory and use novel methods to explain when (types of) emotional appeals are persuasive, and when emotional attachments prevent persuasion. Do politicians actually make more emotional appeals than in the past? And if so why are they doing it? We lack historical data of emotional appeals so we cannot answer these questions. POLEMIC will provide unique, historical data (1945-now, 9 countries) of emotional appeals by politicians in their speeches. I develop and test 3 alternative theories from different intellectual traditions that explain why politicians make emotional appeals: is it either (1) a vote-maximizing strategy, (2) a product of the personality of a politician or (3) just fashionable? POLEMIC analyses emotional appeals of politicians and the emotional responses of citizens to these appeals. Emotional appeals are texts, and emotions are experiences by the brain. To measure them POLEMIC will use innovative methods in political science: automated text analysis to extract emotion from appeals. physiological measurement to measure emotions. POLEMIC offers a ground-breaking combination of a macro-perspective (what politicians say) and a micro-perspective (how citizens respond) and forms a bridge between party politics and political psychology. The project’s output will indicate the importance of emotion in the decision-making of citizens, and the level of rationality that is behind politicians’ decision to make emotional appeals."
INFRAGLOB,AFRICA's ‘INFRASTRUCTURE GLOBALITIES’: Rethinking the Political Geographies of Economic Hubs from the Global South,"Power beyond the state is most prevalent in economic infrastructure hubs with high technology and multiple global actors. Here, investors from emerging powers challenge traditional theory and practice. Chinese and Brazilian companies are now the most important bilateral investors in Africa. They apply existing rules and practices, and introduce new practices of governance and business-society relations that compete with Western norms. But their impact is not properly understood in theories of transnational governance. This project will rethink transnational governance by focusing on the margins of international relations to explain how models and experiences of actors from the Global South redefine the governance of economic hubs. Seemingly in the margins of international political economy, and neglected in International Relations, in Africa new forms of power and governance are invented and tested. Here states are weaker and experiments with multiple non-state actors and modes of governance tolerated. The fringes of theory-building in the discipline, the hubs of transnational economic infrastructure, and everyday practices of cross-border management can be theorized as arenas of the production, contestation and change of transnational governance. INFRAGLOB combines analysing the ideas driving Chinese and Brazilian management of large-scale port and mining projects with multi-sited ethnographic research of exemplary cases in Mozambique and Tanzania, establishing how these concepts are enacted, negotiated and disregarded in practice. It rethinks publics by mapping controversies that connect Africa, Brazil and China, and establishes how interactions and frictions between diverse practitioners and standards change broader transnational governance of business-community relations and security. ‘Infrastructure globalities’ will provide a unique understanding of how the Global South changes practices of governance and business-society relations in a multipolar world."
uEcologies,Urban Ecologies: governing nonhuman life in global cities,"A fundamental dimension of planetary urbanization is its radical transformation of nature. Domestic animals now make up more than twice the biomass of humans on the planet. They are vital to livelihoods of the urban poor in the global south, providing economic opportunities, yet posing zoonotic risks. In contrast, cities of the north are marked by the paucity of animals and concomitant health concerns. Yet, urban ecologies – relations between people and animals, and their interactions with the built environment – have received scant systematic attention in the social sciences. The objective of this project is to lay bare how regulating nonhuman life is fundamental to governing global cities. How are human-animal dynamics differentially composed in cities of the global south and north? What social, economic and spatial forces structure these dynamics? Most global cities regulate animal presence, albeit with varying degrees of success. How then might an expanded notion of urban governance incorporating ecology reorient urban studies? And finally, how might such an analysis help promote resilient and sustainable cities? The project tackles these questions through a comparative analysis focused on New Delhi, Guwahati and London. Using a combination of conventional ethnographic research methods and innovative ecological perspectives, it will generate novel explanatory concepts for understanding urban ecologies and their implications for governing global cities. This research is ground-breaking in four ways: 1) by addressing an uncharted but critical field of human action, it sheds new light on urban governance. 2) by integrating adjacent disciplines that seldom interact, it pushes the frontiers of urban studies. 3) by combining social and ecological perspectives, it adds to methodological innovation in the social sciences. 4) by accounting for how ecology shapes marginalized lives, it contributes to new agendas of making cities resilient for the urban poor."
WorkOD,Work on Demand: Contracting for Work in a Changing Economy,"Labour law as a scholarly discipline is widely believed to be in crisis. Since the time of its birth, both the nature of working relationships and the context within which they are formed and regulated have changed significantly. The difficulty for scholars is that old concepts don’t perform the function anymore of making sense of the field. Old arguments about the need to protect workers’ interests are met with counterarguments, informed by neoclassical economics, that protective measures inhibit economic growth and increase unemployment. The WorkOD project aspires to nothing less than a fundamental transformation of the discipline of labour law across the whole of Europe and beyond. Understanding the crisis to have at its heart a crisis of methodology, it aims to develop a new methodology for the study of the key legal concept of the contract for work. It aims to explain trends in the field of work organisation and working relationships and to assess the significance of particular labour market institutions to the achievement of policy goals in a way that is useful to scholars and policy-makers. And it aims to pave the way for future contributions by scholars to policy debates, so that they may influence in positive ways the identification of new economically and socially sustainable solutions to the problem of the division of responsibilities and risks between workers and those for whom they work. In a marked departure from the state of the art, the project defines contracting for work as an instance of economic, social and legal behaviour, influenced in a variety of ways by the institutional context within which it proceeds. Rejecting the reframing of labour law according to a full blown market paradigm, it argues instead for the utility of sociological methods. Its development of a new methodology begins from a combination of micro and macro perspectives, and a synthesis of approaches drawn from economic sociology, political economy and the sociology of law."
TRICI-Law,The Rules of Interpretation of Customary International Law,"This ERC proposal revolves around the rules of interpretation of customary international law (CIL). CIL along with treaties are the rules most often used in international law. However, whereas rules of interpretation of treaties have been enshrined in Articles 31-33 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT), the rules of interpretation of CIL have not been the subject of critical study. This gap becomes even more pronounced if we consider that interpretation plays a key role in every judicial case, and that one of the basic markers of effectiveness of any legal system is its predictability. By not knowing the rules that govern the interpretation of CIL, we end up playing a ‘game’ the rules of which are unknown, and by consequence predictability is far from guaranteed. Therefore the aim of this project is to determine the existence and to examine the content of the rules of interpretation of customary international law. It will: 1) prove the theoretical validity of CIL being open to interpretation. 2) induce the rules of interpretation of CIL and their content. 3) track the points of convergence/divergence and reasons thereof amongst rules of interpretation of CIL, treaties and unilateral acts as they evolve through time. and 4) create a set of articles/guidelines on the interpretation of CIL. The results will influence the study and theory of CIL. will lead to a re-conceptualization of the theory of sources of international law. will spark a long overdue debate on the interaction between sources of international law. will further our understanding of the process of interpretation and of the basic precepts of the international legal system. and its findings will become the staple point of reference by any ‘user’ of international law. Its ultimate outcomes will clarify the foundations of the international legal system, reduce normative conflict, and provide greater legal certainty and foreseeability in all international law-related interactions."
DLEDA,Do Legislatures Enhance Democracy in Africa?,"Do Legislatures Enhance Democracy in Africa? This project seeks to investigate the role of legislatures in African electoral authoritarian regimes. There are two opposing theoretical views: While several studies have found that holding elections, introducing a national assembly and a multiparty system prolongs the life of autocracies, other authors claim the exact opposite: in their view, the more successive multiparty elections take place, the more democratic a regime becomes. Answering these questions is difficult due to the opaqueness of authoritarian regimes. Moreover, most work has concentrated on only a few cases – African cases, in particular, have remained largely absent from the research agenda. This project attempts to fill these gaps by collecting data on authoritarian legislatures in seven African countries. We focus on three areas of investigation: 1) law-making. 2) interaction patterns and political dialogue between the ruling party and the opposition. and 3) representation and constituency responsiveness. The main question is whether legislatures in authoritarian countries actually have a potential to enhance democracy. We use a Mixed Methods-Design which combines qualitative and quantitative data. To answer Question 1, we use content analysis of parliamentary debates. For Question 2 and 3, we will conduct full population surveys in the national assemblies of our seven countries. We will collect biographical and opinion data, as well as data on the social interactions between government and opposition, which will be analyzed with the methods of Social Network Analysis. Furthermore, we employ process tracing to understand the causal mechanism between legislative behaviour and the level of democracy. With a strong team of partner institutions in seven African countries, this project fills a research gap by collecting extensive and systematic empirical evidence on legislative behaviour in electoral autocracies for the first time."
DUST,Data Assimilation for Agent-Based Models: Applications to Civil Emergencies,"Civil emergencies such as flooding, terrorist attacks, fire, etc., can have devastating impacts on people, infrastructure, and economies. Knowing how to best respond to an emergency can be extremely difficult because building a clear picture of the emerging situation is challenging with the limited data and modelling capabilities that are available. Agent-based modelling (ABM) is a field that excels in its ability to simulate human systems and has therefore become a popular tool for simulating disasters and for modelling strategies that are aimed at mitigating developing problems. However, the field suffers from a serious drawback: models are not able to incorporate up-to-date data (e.g. social media, mobile telephone use, public transport records, etc.). Instead they are initialised with historical data and therefore their forecasts diverge rapidly from reality. To address this major shortcoming, this research will develop dynamic data assimilation methods for use in ABMs. These techniques have already revolutionised weather forecasts and could offer the same advantages for ABMs of social systems. There are serious methodological barriers that must be overcome, but this research has the potential to produce a step change in the ability of models to create accurate short-term forecasts of social systems. The project is largely methodological, and will evidence the efficacy of the new methods by developing a cutting-edge simulation of a city – entitled the Dynamic Urban Simulation Technique (DUST) – that can be dynamically optimised with streaming ‘big’ data. The model will ultimately be used in three areas of important policy impact: (1) as a tool for understanding and managing cities. (2) as a planning tool for exploring and preparing for potential emergency situations. and (3) as a real-time management tool, drawing on current data as they emerge to create the most reliable picture of the current situation."
NEW_DEMOCRACY,Meeting Great Expectations Through Democratic Innovations,"All across Europe democratic political systems are confronted with a citizenry that questions the democratic legitimacy of their political system. Widespread distrust in political actors and institutions, declining electoral turnout and the popularity of populist and anti-establishment candidates and parties are just a few indications of this societal challenge. Interestingly, this discontent is by no means paralleled by eroding support for democratic principles as this support is stronger than ever before. Therefore, several scholars interpreted this discontent as a demand for democratic innovation and pointed to citizen involvement in the political decision-making process as a potential solution to address this democratic legitimacy deficit. The key objective of my project is to study in depth whether, and if so how, citizen involvement in the political decision-making process affects democratic legitimacy. In a first step, citizens’ expectations for participatory and deliberative procedures are studied. Obtaining reliable knowledge on whether citizens want these procedures, and if so, what is driving this demand is crucial. It allows to assess whether democratic innovations have the potential to alleviate the democratic legitimacy deficit, and how these should be designed. To this end, large-scale cross-national surveys in over 20 European countries will be triangulated with qualitative interviews and experiments in high, medium and low trust societies. In a second step, the effect of these participatory and deliberative procedures on democratic legitimacy is studied. The focus is on democratic legitimacy as it is perceived by citizens (e.g. citizens’ political trust, losers’ consent). To address the question of effects, observational data will be gathered using panel surveys and experiments will be used. As a result, this project will generate fundamental knowledge on whether and how democratic innovations can strengthen democratic legitimacy."
SCALAR,Scaling up behavior and autonomous adaptation for macro models of climate change damage assessment,"Damage associated with climate change is a core benchmark in science and policy. Macro Integrated Assessment Models estimating damages are criticized for neglecting risk distribution, adaptation dynamics and the possible collapse of regional economies. Micro-level social science studies contain substantial knowledge on individual behavior, decisions under risk and autonomous climate adaptation, and go beyond monetary losses by focusing on resilience. This knowledge can ameliorate theoretical and empirical flaws in current macro assessments, if adequate scaling up methods were to exist. SCALAR aims to bridge the gap between micro and macro research traditions by modeling the behavioral aspects of autonomous adaptation processes of heterogeneous agents, and integrating them into macro level climate policy models. The project focuses on floods. Its innovative nature allows to revisit the classic micro-macro aggregation problem through a unique combination of: 1) New behavioral data on climate adaptation decisions collected in multiple survey waves using mobile applications, going beyond a snapshot to uncover evolving decision processes. 2) Advances in agent-based modeling to scale up adaptation decisions of heterogeneous households and firms to a regional economy while including land use and hazard data. 3) Cutting-edge ways of integrating micro-simulation models with traditional macro models to synergize the two approaches for developing new theory- and data-grounded macro damage assessments. SCALAR will drive a major breakthrough in integrating behavioral aspects of human decision-making into macro climate policy models. It will enable the quantitative exploration of cross-scale damage cascades, the identification of thresholds over which autonomous adaptation impacts the macro level, and the tracing of the emergence of socio-economic resilience as climate change unfolds. The methodological advancements will have impact far beyond the domain of climate adaptation."
ENERGYA,ENERGY use for Adaptation,"ENERGYA will improve our understanding of how energy and energy services can be used by households and industries to adapt to the risk posed by climate change. Specifically, the project will develop an interdisciplinary and scalable research framework integrating data and methods from economics with geography, climate science, and integrated assessment modelling to provide new knowledge concerning heterogeneity in energy use across countries, sectors, socioeconomic conditions and income groups, and assess the broad implications adaptation-driven energy use can have on the economy, the environment, and welfare. The key novelty of ENERGYA is to link energy statistics and energy survey data with high spatial resolution data from climate science and remote sensing, including high-resolution spatial data on meteorology, population and economic activity distribution, electrification, and the built environment. ENERGYA has three main objectives. First, it will produce novel statistical and econometric analyses for OECD and major emerging countries (Brazil, Mexico, India, and Indonesia) to shed light on the underlying mechanisms driving energy use. Second, it will infer future potential impacts from long-run climate and socioeconomic changes building on historical empirical evidence. Third, it will analyse the macro and distributional implications of adaptation-driven energy use with an economy-energy model characterising the distribution of energy use dynamics across and within countries. Given the central role of energy as multiplier for socioeconomic development and as enabling condition for climate resilience, the research proposed in ENERGYA will result in timely insights for the transition towards sustainability described by the Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the United Nations as well as the Paris International Climate Agreement."
HEFT,Hidden Emissions of Forest Transitions: GHG effects of socio-metabolic processes reducing pressures on forests,"A forest transition, i.e. forest expansion after a long period of deforestation, has occurred in many, mostly industrialized countries. Forest transitions have recently resulted in declining rates of global net deforestation and contributed to carbon (C) sinks in terrestrial ecosystems. Studies have shown the concurrence of forest transitions and industrialization processes, but the systemic links between forest transitions, their underlying socio-metabolic processes and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have been neither systematically explored nor quantified. HEFT introduces the idea of “hidden emissions of forest transitions”, i.e. the GHG emissions from socio-metabolic processes reducing pressures on forests. Hidden emissions may stem from processes such as substitution of fuelwood by modern energy sources, intensification of agriculture, and externalization of biomass production to remote regions. Building on the concept of socio-ecological metabolism, HEFT develops a consistent methodological framework to quantify the full GHG emissions and sinks from socio-metabolic and ecological processes in the course of forest transitions, within which their hidden emissions are identified. Forest transitions in multiple contexts are analyzed at local, national and supranational scales: in Europe since c. 1850, North America since c. 1880, and South East Asia since 1980. A coarse global-scale assessment complements the regional case studies. We will integrate sources and analytical methods from environmental and social sciences as well as the humanities to analyze context-specific trajectories and general features of socio-ecological GHG budgets and their respective socio-political contexts since the onset of forest transitions. The sound understanding of hidden emissions will be used to identify the least GHG-intensive trajectories and to draw lessons for future climate-friendly forest transitions."
reFUEL,Going global? Renewable fuel trade and social land-use restrictions in a low-carbon energy system,"Recent global integrated modelling studies indicate low intensities in trade of energy commodities between global regions in a future low-carbon global energy system. Also, research based on modelling indicates that deep greenhouse-gas emission cuts are possible in fully electrified renewable energy systems on a continental or country scale from a techno-economic perspective. However, these modelling efforts partly neglect drivers of globalization and may therefore wrongly project regionalization of energy systems. In particular, (i) new, easily tradable, low-cost renewable fuels (e.g. solar & electric fuels), (ii) global bio-physical variability of renewables (e.g. solar radiation and freshwater availability), and (iii) regional differences in social land-use restrictions associated with the expansion of energy infrastructure can cause an increase of trade flows in the energy sector. We aim at better understanding how the spatial configuration of renewables in low-carbon energy systems is affected by these drivers and develop a cutting-edge, open-source global renewable energy model that combines elements of energy system and land-use modelling. It takes into account bio-physical conditions for renewable fuel and electricity production, social land availability restrictions, and a map of existing energy infrastructure at unprecedented level of detail. Our approach integrates open data sources from public institutions, user-generated GIS data, and social networks. Existing models for Europe and Brazil are used for validation. Qualitative interviews in local case studies complement the global model and increase our understanding of land-use restrictions on the local scale. Our project has impacts beyond energy systems analysis: in particular the identification of winning and losing regions in a global renewable energy system is highly relevant in climate change mitigation negotiations, and the generated spatial indicators and maps enable many potential applications."
GlobalCitizenshipLaw,Global Citizenship Law: International Migration and Constitutional Identity,"Managing global migration is one of the most pressing issues of our time, particularly in Europe. With more than 230 million international immigrants, the manner in which new citizens are/should be created has become a controversial issue, morally and politically. Traditionally, international law has not regulated nationality law. naturalization requirements remain the last stronghold of national sovereignty. This project advances the establishment of a new subfield in public international law—International Citizenship Law (ICIL)—which would regulate nationality law. It asks a critical and timely question: what are/should be the international legal limitations/privileges imposed on/granted to states in setting naturalization requirements? In order to address this question, the project has five scientific objectives: [1] to investigate the history of the law of naturalization in international law and what it can teach us about 21th-century challenges. [2] to identify the most recent legal developments in the field of naturalization law and establish the most up-to-date international legal standards of naturalization law. [3] to set out the theoretical foundations and the justifications for the establishment of ICIL. [4] to analyze the normative and structural implications derived from an-ICIL approach for future citizenship policy development, as well as to identify the legal reforms that should be taken to promote an-ICIL approach. and [5] to explore the interrelationship between ICIL, immigration policy, and constitutional identity. In essence, the project seeks to formulate international legal standards by which states can admit immigrants without fundamentally changing their cultural heritage and slipping into extreme nationalism. The outcome can serve as a basis for a future reform in international law, EU law, and national legal systems. As the immigration debate reaches a decisive moment, this project has both theoretical significance and policy implications"
PROSANCT,"Bombs, Banks and Sanctions: A Sociology of the Transnational Legal Field of Nuclear Nonproliferation","As the critical sanctions against Iran’s nuclear program demonstrate, the implementation of sanctions (SANCT) against nuclear proliferators (PRO) has lead to the creation of a global system of surveillance of the financial dealings of all states, banks and individuals, fostered by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions. This is a new and unprecedented development in transnational governance. This research will apply a sociological perspective to the study of this new “transnational legal order” by analyzing how new actors, institutions and legal technologies shape the processes of norm-creation and rules-implementation in the field of nuclear nonproliferation. PROSANCT asks: How have the social characteristics of the actors in charge of designing and implementing sanctions influenced the creation of new norms in the field of nonproliferation? Which legal technologies and which discursive practices have these new actors developed to impose their authority and their legitimacy on the regulation of global financial transactions? Answering these questions will generate a better understanding of key processes in global governance: 1) the increasing role of the UNSC as a global legislator through top-down processes of norms diffusion. 2) the “financialization” of global regulation, with the increasing role played by international financial institutions, which were historically foreign to the field of nuclear nonproliferation. and 3) the “judicialization” of the enforcement of sanctions, and the associated reconfiguration of relations between executive and judicial authorities in charge of punishing nuclear proliferators and sanctions-evaders at the domestic level. To study these legal processes in various contexts (the United States and Europe), PROSANCT applies a multi-methods approach that combines interview-based methods with politicians, high-level bureaucrats and diplomats, and experts, and archival research."
LEVIATHAN,Taming the Leviathan? Legal and Political Accountability in 'Post-Crisis' EU Economic Governance,"The Euro Crisis has had a transformative effect on the functional ambitions of the EU. It has, also, however, transformed the ways in which citizens can hold the EU institutions accountable. In the area of economic governance in particular, the post-crisis EU has created a significant new body of fiscal rules, managed largely by executive institutions. The nature of these rules, and the institutions entrusted to manage them, challenges our existing scientific understanding of accountability, creating considerable confusion among citizens as how economic decision-making in an EU context can be properly scrutinized. This project is devoted to addressing EU economic governance's 'post-crisis' accountability challenge. It will provide the first comprehensive and multi-disciplinary attempt to consider how EU decisions in the economic field can be challenged, either by political institutions or by individuals seeking judicial review. In doing so, it will seek to move beyond the disciplinary segmentation and conceptual limitations of current academic debates about accountability, combining legal analysis of decisions of national and EU Courts in economic governance with qualitative research on the political and functional constraints within which institutions reviewing economic decisions operate. The project will also carry a crucial normative dimension, using case studies in important fields of economic policy - from banking regulation to the coordination of national budgets - to map emerging accountability relationships and build recommendations on how to approach post-crisis accountability. Given the reach of EU economic governance into almost all domains of national policy, as well as the declining levels of public trust in EU action, identifying how a more accountable structure for EU policy-making could be built is a crucial scientific and societal task."
REF-MIG,"Refugees are Migrants: Refugee Mobility, Recognition and Rights","This project begins with the basic premise that refugees are migrants: by legal definition and political conception, they have left their home countries to seek refuge. This project aims to re-assess refugee protection through a lens of mobility and migration, locating the study of refugee law in the context of the refugee regime. It examines the three key aspects of refugee law – access to protection, refugee status determination, and refugee rights – bringing them into conversation with the refugee regime’s norms and practices on responsibility-sharing and solutions. Crucially, the project takes a long and broad view of refugee protection, in order to open up new possibilities and trajectories. It also integrates a legal assessment of the role of non-state actors in refugee protection. Using the broad notion of ‘intermediary’ in the migration process, it will assess the regulatory environment on access to protection, so-called ‘secondary movement’ and onward migration. It will provide an important legal assessment of the role of the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and the duties of humanitarian actors in refugee protection. It addresses the EU, not as a singularity, but as an actor in the global regime. The project is methodologically ground-breaking. It identifies practices that determine access to and the quality of refugee protection, and how these practices have developed across jurisdictions and over time, thereby historicizing and reframing the practices in question. As well as rigorous doctrinal (‘black letter’) legal analysis, it will use go beyond doctrine, and draw on theoretical conceptions of legality to explore the particular modes of regulating mobility and migration that are now central to refugee protection. It will also develop new inter-disciplinary methods, using comparative legal, historical and political-scientific tools."
N4I_CLUSTERS,Networking for innovation: how entrepreneurs' network behaviours help clusters to innovate,"In recent years, economic geography has strongly embraced the relational approach: entrepreneurs striving to generate innovations have been shown to benefit from embeddedness in local, cohesive networks if these are combined with connectivity to sparse, global ties that bring diversity. With this heightened importance of networks for innovation, it is rather surprising that academic research has nearly entirely overlooked the role of “networking”. Networks are portrayed as if they are formed exclusively through latent preferences to connect with certain people or through contextual factors that make people accidently connect. This leaves little space for entrepreneurs’ deliberate attempts to create the social capital they believe will help them innovate. We thus lack the micro-level theoretical foundations of the network-innovation relationship in economic geography. My research aims to build these foundations by developing a network behavioural approach to innovation in entrepreneurial clusters. I seek to investigate how within-cluster variation in entrepreneurs’ innovation performance may originate in differences in network behaviour and how between-cluster variation in performance may originate in the spread of effective network behaviours within but not between clusters. Answers to these questions should lead to fundamentally new insights into why certain clusters thrive as hubs of innovation and why certain entrepreneurs within clusters contribute more to the innovation in clusters than others. I will collect granular qualitative and quantitative data of the network behaviours of entrepreneurs through interviews, multi-wave surveys and online network monitoring tools to unveil how they decide which ties to build and which ones to call on in specific situations. I will then assess how these behaviours enable or constrain entrepreneurs and, in aggregate, clusters to innovate using large-scale econometric analyses as well social science experiments."
TRIPOD,The transition to a renewable electricity system and its interactions with other policy aims,"In order to meet its long-term climate targets, the European Union has decided to reduce its power sector carbon emissions by 93-99% by 2050. This means that Europe aims to transition to a largely, or fully, renewable power system. This is however not the only energy policy aim: besides a transition to renewables, further aims include an energy efficiency increase and demand reduction. liberalisation of the power markets and exposure of renewables to competition. and europeanisation of renewable energy policy, power grids, and the creation of a European internal power market. Here, I investigate whether and how these policies interact and affect the chances for and costs of a transition to a renewable power system. how the other aims constrain the options for renewables. and how policy conflicts can be resolved. Current policy discourse treats these policy aims either as independent or synergistic. My hypothesis is that they are not at all independent and that pursuing the aims of demand reduction, liberalisation and europeanisation strongly influences the transition to renewables, and that the aims are partially antagonistic, implying a need for trade-offs. The purpose of my research is to test these hypotheses and explore the policy synergies or antagonisms, by investigating yet under-researched aspects of the interactions. These include how reaching the other aims influences the transition dynamics. how key actors may alter their behaviour due to such other developments. and how reaching another policy aim impacts the stability of a fully renewable power system. I adopt an interdisciplinary approach, drawing on transition research, engineering, political science and economics, with each perspective adding a piece of the puzzle. The answers will contribute to both the disciplinary and the policy-driven renewable energy research, and provide insights to help policy-makers define less conflicting policies, thus supporting the European transition to renewables."
RICA,"Reputation Matters in the Regulatory State: Re-thinking the Fundamentals of Regulatory Independence, Credibility and Accountability","RICA will fundamentally challenge, reconceptualise and redefine core foundational assumptions of the regulatory state. Arm’s length governance and regulatory independence have become the cornerstone normative and institutional design principles of the European regulatory state. Regulatory credibility is premised on agency insulation from politics with major systemic implications in the form of a rise in non-majoritarianism and a parallel devaluation of the political process. Efforts to compensate through alternative sources of input legitimacy have proven challenging. Conceptualised in a rational-choice tradition, accountability is seen to be in a zero-sum relationship with regulatory autonomy. Bolstering accountability is said to threaten autonomy, undermining the system’s normative foundations. Informed by insights from the political science literature on reputation, RICA profoundly questions these assumptions. It does so in two separate and interlocking tracks. Module 1 theorises about, and tests, the established wisdom of a wholesale positive relation between agency insulation and credibility. To the contrary, from a reputational perspective, a strategy of insulation is expected to have a negative effect on regulatory credibility, with overall delegitimising effects. Similarly informed by reputation insights, Module 2 challenges dominant understandings of accountability and puts forward the building blocks of a new theory of public accountability. The module draws out and studies empirically how reputation shapes the accountability behaviour of regulatory actors, both account-holders and account-givers, and their interactions. It will re-conceptualise the role played by accountability in the regulatory state as well as its relationship with autonomy. In contrast to dominant understandings, as a mechanism of reputation-building, accountability can reinforce autonomy with sweeping implications for regulatory control strategies and institutional design choices."
TechEvo,Technology Evolution in Regional Economies,"The creation and accumulation of knowledge are processes at the heart of technological change and economic growth. Attention has been directed at aggregate measures of knowledge production in regional and national contexts, but little consideration has been given to the properties of knowledge produced in specific places. How does the nature of knowledge that is produced vary over space, what conditions the scope of technologies generated in different locations, and how do these knowledge sets impact the performance of local firms and industries? To date, the way in which specific regional knowledge capabilities influence the evolution of local technology trajectories and thus shape geographies of economic prosperity have not yet been considered systematically. The objective of the “Technology Evolution in Regional Economies” (TechEvo) project is to address these significant shortcomings. Focusing on the evolution of scientific and technical knowledge, as indicated by patent, trademark and scientific literature records, the point of departure is the pan-European knowledge space for all 28 European Union member countries, plus Norway and Switzerland, over the time period 1981-2015. The knowledge space, based on the co-occurrence matrix of particular knowledge domains (629), maps the proximity of patent technology classes and enables the development of regional measures of knowledge specialization for all 1,369 (NUTS3) regions. Set in an evolutionary framework the investigation provides ground breaking insights into how innovative entities and individual inventors are embedded in social and cognitive local and non-local networks, and how regional technology trajectories are shaped through entry, exit, and selection processes. TechEvo will provide a wealth of indicators, models and tools that will assist firms and policy makers in place-based investment decisions, and deliver a science and technology policy evaluation tool capable of assessing impact."
CLLS,Analysing coherence in law through legal scholarship,"Coherence of law is created in the writings of legal scholars who systematize rules and principles of law. Their pursuit of coherence is vital for the effectiveness of legal systems. However, coherence of law has almost not been analysed in a systematic, empirical way. The project will therefore develop a methodology that will address coherence across forms (‘sources’) of law (legislation, legal scholarship, case law, customs), across themes (e.g. criminal law and contracts) and across authors, and which will additionally encompass interaction with societal demand and contextual factors. The methodology will be ground-breaking because it will disentangle the concept of coherence into measurable modes of interconnectedness, weighing them together so as to assess (in)coherence at the level of the legal system. This methodology will constitute a stepping stone for a new field of dynamic coherence of law created through legal scholarship that will ultimately improve the quality of law. It will be founded on academic writings on law from the early modern period (ca. 1500 - ca. 1800) that concern the theme of collateral rights, that is, those rights facilitating expropriation of the assets of debtors in case of their default. Indications are that the impact of rules on collateral rights hinged on coherence as established in legal writings, and that in the period mentioned legal coherence for this theme was increasing. Coherence in development will be traced in the interpretations of legal scholars following on from interactions between scholarly writings, local law (bylaws, judgments) and commercial practice (contracts). Connections of rules and principles found will be presented in frames of analysis that cluster them along variables of context, time and source of law. The combination of legal analysis with a broad scope of coherence (cross-source, context-driven) will build bridges across gaps now existing between the different disciplines that study law."
INFO-LEG,Understanding information for legal protection of people against information-induced harms,"Information can harm people. Think of being denied mortgage or insurance based on your grocery shopping or online surfing profile. But what exactly is it in information that is harmful, and how can people be protected? The current legal answer is that protection (data protection principles, rights and obligations) is granted when a) there is information b) about or potentially affecting a person c) who is identified or identifiable. This is Personally Identifiable Information (PII). But now that virtually all information is PII, how can law meaningfully protect against information-induced harms? Given modern data collection and processing techniques and unprecedented amounts of data available for analysis, everything can be translated into data and anyone can be identifiable in data sets. Therefore, PII-based legal protection will fail, since a law regulating everything is meaningless. Yet, alternatives for structuring legal protection other than through the concept of PII are lacking. INFO-LEG innovates by looking for substitutes for the notion of PII to fundamentally re-organise legal protection. Promising new organising notions will be found through better understanding of information, how it links to people and harms. The approach is unique in integrating how law, economics, and information studies conceptualise information. INFO-LEG will theoretically and empirically explore external and internal conceptual boundaries of information and produce a multidisciplinary taxonomy of information. The notions from this taxonomy will be assessed on their suitability to substitute PII as new organising notions for legal protection against information-induced harms. The multidisciplinary conceptualisation of information will impact scholarships studying how other areas of law regulate information in digital age: intellectual property (drawing borders of rights in information objects). constitutional law (if data is protected speech). telecommunication and cybercrime."
QUALIDEM,Eroding Democracies. A qualitative (re-)appraisal of how policies shape democratic linkages in Western democracies,"The future consolidation or erosion of western democracies depends on the political perceptions, experiences and participation of ordinary citizens. Even when they disagree on the implications of their findings, previous studies stress that both attitudinal and behavioural forms of democratic linkages – political trust, political support, loyalty, formal and informal participation – have come under considerable pressure in recent decades. The QUALIDEM project offers a qualitative (re)appraisal of citizens’ (dis-)affection towards politics by relying on the core argument of the policy feedback literature: attitudes and behaviours are outcomes of past policy. It aims to explain the evolutions of democratic linkages as being shaped by public policy, and specifically by the turn to neoliberalism and supranationalisation. It aims to systematically analyse the domestic and socially differentiated effects of both of these major macro transformations to citizens’ representations and experiences of politics, as an addition to the existing emphasis on individual determinants and the existing contextual explanations of disengagement and disaffection towards politics. On the theoretical level, this project therefore aims to build bridges between scholars of public policy and students of mass politics. On the empirical level, QUALIDEM relies on the reanalysis of qualitative data – interviews and focus groups – from a diachronic and comparative perspective focusing on four Western European countries (Belgium, France, Germany and the UK) with the US serving as a counterpoint. It will renew the methodological approach to the question of ordinary citizens’ disengagement and disaffection by providing a detailed and empirically-grounded understanding of the mechanisms of production and change in democratic linkages. It will develop an innovative methodological infrastructure for the storage of and access to twenty years of qualitative European comparative surveys."
ELWar,Electoral Legacies of War: Political Competition in Postwar Southeast Europe,"We know remarkably little about the impact of war on political competition in postwar societies in spite of the fact that postwar elections have garnered tremendous interest from researchers in a variety of fields. That interest, however, has been limited to establishing the relationship between electoral democratization and the incidence of conflict. Voters’ and parties’ electoral behaviour after the immediate post‐conflict period have remained largely neglected by researchers. The proposed project will fill this gap in our understanding of electoral legacies of war by analysing the evolution of political competition over the course of more than two decades in the six postwar states of Southeast Europe: Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, and Serbia. Organised around three thematic areas/levels of analysis – voters, parties, communities – the project will lead to a series of important contributions. Through a combination of public opinion research, oral histories, and the innovative method of matching of individual census entries, the project will answer to which extent postwar elections are decided by voters’ experiences and perceptions of the ended conflict, as opposed to their considerations of the parties’ peacetime economic platforms and performance in office. In-depth study of party documents and platforms, party relations with the organisations of the postwar civil sector, as well as interviews with party officials and activists will shed light on the influence of war on electoral strategies, policy preferences, and recruitment methods of postwar political parties. And a combination of large-N research on the level of the region’s municipalities and a set of paired comparisons of several communities in the different postwar communities in the region will help expose the mechanisms through which war becomes embedded into postwar political competition and thus continues to exert its influence even decades after the violence has ended."
ConflictNET,The Politics and Practice of Social Media in Conflict,"Over the next five years an unprecedented number of initiatives will coalesce, contributing to an extension of the reach of the Internet to the world’s most remote regions. While previous efforts to expand Internet access have focused on urban areas, current initiatives are leveraging new technologies from drones to satellites to provide affordable access to the worlds poorest, many of whom are in Africa and live in regions where the state is weak and there is protracted violent conflict. Current debates have largely focused on technical issues of improving access, or assumed ways that technology will help ‘liberate’ populations or improve governance. This project focuses on a key puzzle that is often overlooked: How does increased access to social media affect the balance between peace-building efforts and attempts perpetuate violence in conflict-affected communities? With a focus on Africa (and particularly on religious and political violence in Eastern Africa), this project will investigate the relationship between social media and conflict through three research questions at the macro, meso and micro level: how are social media altering the transnational dimensions of conflict and peacebuilding? How are public authorities reacting to, and appropriating, social media to either encourage violence or promote peace? And in what ways are social media changing the way people experience, participate in, or respond to violent conflict? It will examine these questions in the context of dangerous speech online. the exit and entry of individuals away from, and into, conflict. the tactics and strategies actors adopt to shape the Internet. and how governance actors are leveraging social media in conflict-affected communities."
WELFAREPRIORITIES,"Welfare state politics under pressure: Identifying priorities, trade-offs and reform opportunities among citizens, political and economic elites","In times of austerity, the politics of the welfare state involve tough choices and even trade-offs: whose risks should benefit from social solidarity in a context of shrinking resources? Should the welfare state prioritize the needs of the elderly or those of the young? Those of people in the workforce or outside of the workforce? Of natives or of immigrants? How countries answer these key questions depends on the welfare state priorities of citizens, political elites and economic elites. However, we know still very little about these priorities and their determinants, and we know even less about the mechanisms that foster support for social solidarity – i.e. support for inclusive social security beyond self-interest. This project wants to make use of recent methodological advances to investigate precisely these priorities and mechanisms. The project will have two phases: the goal of the first phase is to identify the most salient distributive conflicts and welfare trade-offs in eight European countries. It includes an original data collection on social policy priorities among citizens, politicians, employers and trade unions (based on conjoint survey and interviews), as well as content analysis of the actual welfare politics in these countries. The second phase builds on the findings of the first phase, but its objective is to go beyond conflict towards coalitions. It will again combine conjoint surveys and content analysis to identify the factors that foster support for social policies among those actors who are unlikely to benefit directly from these policies. The project will investigate the relative importance of three factors: compensation, framing and mediation. The project breaks new theoretical and methodological ground in comparative welfare state research. It conceptualizes and studies both the trade-offs and the potentials for coalitions, which will determine the fate of the European welfare state in the 21st century."
NEEDS,Dynamic Urban Environmental Exposures on Depression and Suicide,"19% of the Dutch population suffer from depression and people affected by depression have a significantly higher suicide risk. Although the World Health Organization attributes modifiable environmental factors including urban environments (i.e. the built, natural and social environments) to health outcomes, they are largely disregarded as either stressors or buffers in scientific debates on depression and suicide. A limitation of current studies is that urban environmental features are often restricted to the neighbourhoods within which people live. This may result in incorrect conclusions about health-influencing factors and inappropriate policies. Human life ultimately unfolds over space-time. people are exposed to multiple urban environments not only during daily life but also over the course of their lives. It is this, not yet assessed spatiotemporal interplay of urban exposures that might revolutionize health assessments. This research aims to understand the interactions between urban environments, depression and suicide in the Netherlands. The scientific breakthrough will be dynamic health geographies embedded in space-time by two innovative case studies. We will investigate the following research questions: What are the associations between depression and the built, natural and social urban environments along people’s daily space-time paths? And what are the associations between suicide and the built, natural and social urban environments of previous residential locations? A multidisciplinary approach combining health, geographic information science and urban geography will lead to this breakthrough. It will be grounded on cutting-edge smartphone-based human tracking, health register data and spatiotemporal modelling. Knowledge about dynamic urban exposures is key to revealing disease aetiologies, advancing health preventions and formulating policies supporting a healthier urban living."
REFORMED,Reforming Schools Globally: A Multi-Scalar Analysis of Autonomy and Accountability Policies in the Education Sector,"Most countries in the world are facing reform pressures to make their education systems more effective and responsive to the new challenges generated by the global economy. In this scenario, managerial policy ideas such as school autonomy and accountability, which aim to modernize public education and strengthen its performance, are spreading broadly. To date, a wide range of countries with different administrative traditions and levels of development have adopted school autonomy with accountability (SAWA) policies, whilst the most active international organizations in the education sector, like the OECD, are strongly promoting them globally. Constituting SAWA as a global model of education reform generates two main questions. First, why and how are SAWA policies disseminating globally, and to what extent does this reform model generate international policy convergence in education? Secondly, how and under what particular contextual and institutional circumstances do SAWA policies work and for whom? The fact that existing scholarly research has achieved inconclusive and mixed findings concerning the SAWA effects on learning outcomes and equity makes this second question especially relevant. To address these gaps in existing literature, REFORMED develops a comprehensive research approach that scrutinizes the different, but mutually constitutive stages of global education policy, from the inception in global agendas stage to their operationalization and effects in multiple contexts. Specifically, the project analyzes how and why SAWA policies are being adopted and re-formulated by policy actors operating at different scales (from international bureaucrats to teachers), and inquires into the institutional frameworks and policy enactment processes that explain the different effects of SAWA at the school level. A robust and multi-scalar methodological strategy that combines quantitative and qualitative methods will contribute to advancing such an innovative approach."
JUDI-ARCH,The Rise of Judicial Self-Government: Changing the Architecture of Separation of Powers without an Architect,"Many European states have transferred decision-making powers regarding court administration and the career of a judge from political bodies to special organs in which judges have a major say. Judicial councils and other bodies of judicial self-government (JSG) spread particularly quickly during the European Union (EU) Accession Process. However, the effects of these bodies are not fully understood, as the traditional descriptive and normative scholarship is not able to capture them. JUDI-ARCH will fill this gap and address the implications of this phenomenon for the “new” as well as “old” EU member states. The central research question of JUDI-ARCH is: how the rise of JSG has changed the concept of separation of powers? More specifically, the JUDI-ARCH proposal consists of three interrelated research aims. The first is to assess the impact of JSG on public confidence in and the independence, accountability, transparency and legitimacy of the domestic judiciaries of 14 European states and the two European supranational courts, both the actual and the perceived. The second aim is to examine what impact the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) and the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) have had on domestic judicial design and, vice versa, how has domestic judicial design affected the selection of judges of the ECtHR and the CJEU. The third overarching aim is to analyse the impact of JSG on the concept of separation of powers. A major innovation in our approach will be the integration of comparative legal perspective with sociological and political science approaches. We will conduct in-depth conceptual, qualitative and quantitative case studies on the impact of different models of JSG in both “new” and “old” EU Member States, including longitudinal quantitative analysis of the use of mechanisms of judicial independence and accountability before and after the creation of a JSG body and in-depth elite interviews."
urban-rev politics,The Urban Revolution and the Political,"This project is a transnational and comparative study of the political implications of the contemporary ‘urban revolution,’ namely the sweeping socio-cultural, economic, and territorial transformations through which the urban becomes the predominant mode of existence of societies across the world. Across the social sciences and as well as journalistic literatures, there has been a remarkable proliferation of debates around the social and ecological implications of contemporary urbanization. What is largely missing in these timely debates, however, is any systematic and in-depth engagement with the political significance of the ongoing ‘urban revolution.’ This is due to a lack of systematic research and theoretical engagement regarding the unprecedented prominence of accumulation regimes based on the speculative production, trade and consumption of space. Similarly, extant theoretical tools of urban political analysis fall short of conceptualizing the increasingly planetary nature of privatization and exploitation of the urban and their intricate links to global finance. In addressing these gaps the project advances two overarching goals: 1. to develop conceptual tools for and comparative insights into the increasingly dominant urban-based accumulation regimes, and 2. to advance the politicization of academic and public discourses on the planetary urban condition. I propose three relational levels (extended moments) of analysis, which respectively focus on the finance/real-estate/state nexus, the exploitation of the urban, and the emerging spaces of the political. These correspond to three subprojects that focus on transnational, everyday, and political dimensions of the urban revolution. The methodological approach will be multi-sited global ethnography, which will combine ethnographies of place-based relations and transnational networks. Filmmaking will be used not only as a research method but also as a storytelling medium."
BROKERS,Participatory Urban Governance between Democracy and Clientelism: Brokers and (In)formal Politics,"The emergence of participatory governance has resulted in the delegation of governmental responsibilities to citizens. Individuals position themselves as voluntary mediators, or brokers, between the government and their fellow citizens. This research asks: what are the roles of such brokers in participatory urban governance, and how do they influence democratic governance? This study will investigate ethnographically how brokers position themselves in administrative schemes, and examine the formal and informal dimensions of their performance. It will analyse the practices, discourses and networks, both in and out of officially sanctioned channels and government institutions. The research approaches brokers as ‘assemblers’, connective agents who actively bring together different governmental and citizen actors, institutions and resources. The scholarly debate on brokerage within participatory governance is divided into two different arguments: first, an argument about neoliberal deregulation located in the Global North, which encourages the practices of active citizen-mediators, and second, a modernization argument in the Global South, which sees brokers as remnants of a clientelist political system. This research will combine these arguments to study settings in both the North and the South. It employs a comparative urbanism design to study four cities that are recognized as pioneers in democratic participatory governance, two in the North and two in the South: Rotterdam (NL), Manchester (UK), Cochabamba (Bolivia) and Recife (Brazil). This research builds upon theories from political anthropology, urban studies, citizenship studies and public administration to develop a new framework for analysing brokerage in participatory urban governance. Understanding how the formal and informal dimensions of participatory governance are entwined will contribute to our ability to theorize the conditions under which this type of governance can give rise to more democratic cities."
SNSNEWS,The new flow of news : how social network sites transform news organization and citizens political behavior,"News industry is undergoing a major transition: Traditional news consumption is on the decline, while citizens increasingly turn their attention to social network sites (SNSs). To accommodate this trend, news industry has been incorporating SNSs into its platforms, changing news into a social product. The project will explore this process and reveal its implications for news production and audiences’ political behavior. I develop a new model anchored in network logic and involving three key actors in news creation and distribution: news organizations, which are adapting news production to the logic of sharing. news feeders – users who select and disseminate news stories, thereby serving as a bridge between their online followers and news organizations. and news feedees – individuals whose news consumption is limited to stories fetched for them by feeders in their SNSs. The model points to some long-term effects on individuals' political beliefs and behavior as a consequence of acting as feeders or feedees. Multiple innovative methods will be employed, some of which will be implemented in the field of media and political studies for the first time. The methods are mutually complementary, combining ‘big data’ analysis with small-N in-depth designs. To study news organizations, I will interview news editors and analyze traffic data juxtaposing it against content analysis. To study users’ behavior and identify feeders and feedees, I will conduct a laboratory observation in which surfing behavior and physiological attention indices will be measured unobtrusively. Long-term political effects will be tested using a combination of survey panel data and web-based behavioral data spanning a period of two years. The proposal is theoretically and empirically innovative and can impact future research by providing novel conceptualization of news distribution, consumption and influence, as well as by introducing a new methodological ‘golden standard’ to audience research."
PRILA,"Prisons: the Rule of Law, Accountability and Rights","PRILA will create the first account of how mechanisms for securing rights, ensuring accountability and achieving adherence to the rule of law are experienced in European prisons. Prisons are places where considerable power differentials exist, and are unique sites for the expression of the values which underpin public and prison law. Systems to ensure that prisoners are treated fairly and that rights are upheld are essential to ensure that imprisonment is conducted in ways that are just and promote good order. These are fundamental principles of the ‘European’ way in penal policy and penal law. Existing accounts of the deployment of penal power overlook key elements of how accountability, the rule of law, and rights are experienced. PRILA will document how prisoners, prison staff, staff of accountability bodies experience structures for ensuring decisions and actions taken in prison are fair, transparent, consistent, subject to appeal and review, and in compliance with principles of human rights. In doing so, PRILA will transform and extend accounts of legitimacy in prisons, judicial review of administrative action, the pains of imprisonment, and understandings of how penal power is experienced. Drawing on the disciplines of public and prison law, human rights, comparative law, and the sociology of punishment, the project will utilise legal, qualitative and quantitative research methods to create an account of how ‘accountability work’ is experienced. It will also examine how accountability structures are manifestations of penal ideologies or types of prison regimes. The project will advance current judicial and legal conceptions of accountability, the rule of law, and fairness, by reference to how these concepts are experienced in practice, and examine whether and how they are distinctively ‘European’. The project will thereby support the creation of better penal policies and practices aimed at the protection of the rule of law and rights in the prison context."
MiTSoPro,Migration and Transnational Social Protection in (post-)crisis Europe,"The negative employment and social developments across Europe since the start of the crisis, coupled with increased fiscal constraints and changing migration patterns, have led to increasing depictions of EU and third-country immigrants as ‘abusers’ of their social protection systems. Member States have accordingly sought reduce migrants’ ability to access social protection benefits, despite the fact that they are disproportionately at risk of poverty and social exclusion. This project looks at the different strategies that migrants have to access social protection within (post) crisis Europe and does so by explicitly integrating social policy and migration studies’ approaches on the phenomenon. More precisely, it aims to study transnational social protection, that we define as migrants’ cross-border strategies to cope with social risks in areas such as health, long-term care, pensions or unemployment that combine entitlements to host and home state-based public welfare policies and market-, family- and community-based practices. This study thus consists in, first, identifying the social protection policies and programs that home countries make accessible to their citizens abroad, and then compiling this information into an online database. We will then aggregate the results of the database into a Transnational Social Protection Index (TSPIx) in order to determine the overall level of engagement of each state with citizens abroad in a comparative way. Second, on the basis of the results of the index, we will select case studies of migrants from two EU and two non-EU countries that vary in their level of engagement in providing social protection to their citizens abroad. We will then undertake multi-sited ethnographic fieldwork to qualitatively assess the informal social protection strategies used by migrants and examine their interaction with formal host and home state social protection provision."
BAR2LEGAB,Women travelling to seek abortion care in Europe: the impact of barriers to legal abortion on women living in countries with ostensibly liberal abortion laws,"In many European countries with ostensibly liberal abortion laws, women face legal restrictions to abortion beyond the first trimester of pregnancy, as well as other barriers to legal abortion, in particular shortages of providers willing and able to offer abortion due to poor training and to conscientious objection among physicians. The Council of Europe has recognized that conscientious objection can make access to safe abortion more difficult or impossible, particularly in rural areas and for low income women, who are forced to travel far to seek abortion care, including abroad. The WHO also highlights that delaying abortion care increases risks for women’s reproductive health. Despite the relevance of this topic from a public health and human rights perspective, the impact of procedural and social barriers to legal abortion on women in countries with ostensibly liberal abortion laws has not been studied by social scientists in Europe. This five-year research project is envisaged as a ground-breaking multi-disciplinary, mixed-methods investigation that will fill this gap, by capitalizing on previous, pioneer anthropological research of the PI on abortion and conscientious objection. It will contribute to the anthropology of reproduction in Europe, and particularly to the existing literature on abortion, conscientious objection and the medicalization of reproduction, and to the international debate on gender inequalities and citizenship, by exploring how barriers to legal abortion are constructed and how women embody and challenge them in different countries, by travelling or seeking illegal abortion, as well as their conceptualizations of abortion and their self perception as moral/political subjects. The project will be carried out in France, Italy and Spain, where the few existing studies show that women face several barriers to legal abortion as well as in the UK, the Netherlands and Spain, where Italian and French women travel to seek abortion care."
CASSPIN,Comparative Analysis of Social Spaces in Post-Industrial Nations,"The proposed research has two overarching objectives. First, it aims to examine whether it is possible and appropriate to extend a novel way of measuring social class recently devised for the United Kingdom to other post-industrial nations for the purposes of cross-national comparative research. If it is, the project will begin to explore, through secondary and primary analysis of large-scale survey data, the different shapes and trajectories of the class structures – or ‘social spaces’ – of various nation states. This will involve examination of which classes and sub-classes predominate and which have emerged or declined, as well as the different gender and ethnic/nationality constitutions of the classes and the distinct effects these differences have for understanding cultural and political struggles and, ultimately, the distribution of power or ‘recognition’ in each country. Second, the project aims to explore, through both statistical analysis and qualitative interviews, how social class is actually lived, experienced and balanced against other pressures and sources of recognition in everyday life, with a focus on three specific nations: the United States, Germany and Sweden. Of particular interest in this respect is the balancing of desire for recognition through money and education – the two cornerstones of social class in post-industrial capitalist societies – and their associated lifestyles with desires for recognition and love within the family. The comparative analysis included in both research aims will be guided by the hypothesis that national differences depend on the nature of the welfare regime in operation, especially as it relates to the nature and extent of workforce feminisation, though the research will also be alive to the possibility of alternative – or no significant – sources of contrast."
DIPLOFACE,Diplomatic Face-Work - between confidential negotiations and public display,"The rise of social media, coupled with intensifying demands for more transparency and democracy in world politics, brings new challenges to international diplomacy. State leaders and diplomats continue to react to traditional media, but now also attempt to present themselves proactively through tweets, public diplomacy and nation branding. These efforts often take place simultaneously and sometimes interfere directly with closed-door negotiations and its culture of restraint and secrecy. Yet the relationship between confidential diplomacy and public representation remains understudied. DIPLOFACE will develop a sociologically and anthropologically informed approach to studying how state leaders and diplomats manage their nation’s ‘faces’ in the information age. The project will explore the relationship and tensions between confidential diplomatic negotiations and publicly displayed interventions in various media, applying the micro-sociological concept of ‘face-work’. DIPLOFACE will analyse the complex interactional dynamics that shape the diplomatic techniques and strategies used to convey a nation’s ‘face’ or ‘image of self’. Such face-work is increasingly important for national leaders and diplomats who perform simultaneously on the ‘back-stage’ and the ‘front-stage’ of international relations. DIPLOFACE will identify, theorize and analyse the repertoire of face-saving, face-honouring and face-threatening practices that are employed in confidential negotiations and in public. DIPLOFACE advances our theoretical understanding of diplomacy in the 21st century significantly beyond existing International Relations and diplomatic theory. Combining participant observation, interviews and media analysis, DIPLOFACE will generate important new knowledge about the relationship between public and confidential multilateral negotiation, how state leaders and diplomats handle new media, and the role of face-saving and face-threatening strategies in international relations."
CLIMASLOW,Slowing Down Climate Change: Combining Climate Law and Climate Science to Identify the Best Options to Reduce Emissions of Short-Lived Climate Forcers in Developing Countries,"The ClimaSlow project opens new interdisciplinary horizons to identify the best opportunities to enhance the global legal and regulatory framework for reducing emissions of short-lived climate pollutants (SLCFs), with particular attention to developing countries as projected key sources of future SLCF emissions. It proceeds from the assumption that strengthening the global legal and regulatory framework for SLCFs would bring important benefits in terms of slowing down climate change and reducing local air pollution. However, legal and regulatory options to step up action on SLCFs have not been studied comprehensively. Furthermore, the climate impacts of the various options are not adequately understood. In contrast to traditional legal analysis that would focus one legal system or instrument, the project will study the relevant legal and regulatory frameworks comprehensively, considering the international, regional, national and transnational levels. It will seek to identify various options, both formal legal instruments and informal regulatory initiatives, to strengthen the global legal and regulatory frameworks applicable to SLCFs. In addition to providing information on best options to regulate SLCFs, this novel, comprehensive approach will help scholars to improve their understanding of the implications of ongoing changes in global legal landscape, including its presumed fragmentation and deformalisation. Addressing an important gap in current knowledge, the project will combine analysis of the merits of the various legal and regulatory options with estimates of their climate change impacts on the basis of climate modeling. This way, it will be able to identify the alternatives that are the most promising both from the legal point of view and in terms of climate change mitigation potential. The project will generate information that is policy-relevant and context-specific but can simultaneously provide broader lessons and open new interdisciplinary horizons."
CBTC,The Resurgence in Wage Inequality and Technological Change: A New Approach,"Social-science explanations for rising wage inequality have reached a dead end. Most economists argue that computerization has been primarily responsible, while on the other side of the argument are sociologists and political scientists who stress the role of political forces in the evolution process of wages. I would like to use my knowledge and experience to come up with an original theory on the complex dynamics between technology and politics in order to solve two unsettled questions regarding the role of computerization in rising wage inequality: First, how can computerization, which diffused simultaneously in rich countries, explain the divergent inequality trends in Europe and the United States? Second, what are the mechanisms behind the well-known observed positive correlation between computers and earnings? To answer the first question, I develop a new institutional agenda stating that politics, broadly defined, mitigates the effects of technological change on wages by stimulating norms of fair pay and equity. To answer the second question, I propose a truly novel perspective that conceptualizes the earnings advantage that derives from computerization around access to and control of information on the production process. Capitalizing on this new perspective, I develop a new approach to measuring computerization to capture the form of workers’ interaction with computers at work, and build a research strategy for analysing the effect of computerization on wages across countries and workplaces, and over time. This research project challenges the common understanding of technology’s role in producing economic inequality, and would thereby significantly impact all of the abovementioned disciplines, which are debating over the upswing in wage inequality, as well as public policy, which discusses what should be done to confront the resurgence of income inequality."
MobileKids,Children in multi-local post-separation families,"This project focuses on the experience of two cohorts of children aged 10 to 16 who are living in multi-local, post-separation families in Belgium, in France and in Italy, that is, families where the mother and the father are either divorced or separated, live in different households in the same country, and share the physical custody of their child(ren). A major goal of this project is to investigate the diversity of children’s experience of multi-local family life and identify their specific needs, through children’s own accounts of their lives. This means understanding if, and under what circumstances, children appropriate their multi-local lives and develop an habitus that incorporates the capacity to maintain social relations in a multi-local context and to appropriate mobility and virtual connectedness. The project combines three levels of analysis: the macro-level of policies, the meso-level of family environments (family resources, cultures and practices. and spatial contexts), and the micro-level of children’s lives, which consists in examining how children maintain their social and family relationships as they move with various temporalities between two households that are located in specific administrative territories and spatial entities. This means understanding how children’s interpersonal relationships and networks of significant others shape, and are re-shaped by their mobility in post-separation families. and the interconnections between geographical and virtual mobility. The study combines four methods: a policy analysis of multilocality, secondary data analysis of relevant databases, semi-structured interviews with children’s mothers and fathers, and a qualitative, in-depth study of the lived experiences of children."
SOGICA,Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Claims of Asylum: A European human rights challenge,"This project will generate the first ever theoretically and empirically-grounded comparative and comprehensive picture of the status and legal experiences of asylum-seekers across Europe claiming international protection on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity (SOGI), and determine how the European asylum systems can treat more fairly asylum claims based on the claimant’s SOGI. Every year, thousands of individuals claim asylum in Europe based on their SOGI, and more often than not their claims are treated unfairly, especially considering the disproportionately high rate of refusals on these grounds. There have been very limited attempts to address this issue, and this research will overcome this gap by carrying out a study more comprehensive than any other done in this field in the past, and producing outcomes that are unparalleled in terms of their reach. My main objectives are: 1) to analyse how SOGI related claims are adjudicated in different asylum legal European frameworks (EU, CoE, Germany, Italy, UK), and 2) to produce detailed policy recommendations in regard to the national, European Union and Council of Europe asylum adjudication systems, to the effect of developing a system that addresses adequately the socio-cultural, gender identity and sexual diversity of asylum-seekers. For the first time, a combined comparative, interdisciplinary (socio-legal), human rights and empirical approach will be adopted to research this field, which requires a substantial long period of research and sustained funding. This approach ensures the unique character of the findings and their impact on improving the current law, policy and decision-making regarding SOGI asylum claims, which are increasingly under close scrutiny across Europe. I am in a unique position to achieve these objectives, in the light of my experience with publications , projects and NGOs in the field of human rights and refugees from socio-legal, empirical and European perspectives."
HOMInG,"The Home-Migration Nexus: Home as a Window on Migrant Belonging, Integration and Circulation","The experience of home lies at the core of everyday life, but only through migration is it revealed as a complex and elusive social construction, whose micro analysis illuminates macro social issues and problems. How home works in the life trajectories of those who left it behind, and what the search for home says of immigrant integration and of the influence of mobility on domesticity, are the central questions of HOMInG. By deconstructing the tension between the static face of home and the dynamic face of migrant lives, this programme marks a turning point in the study of the social and emotional appropriation of space. It builds on a mixed-method research design on home as experienced by labour and forced migrants, under different household arrangements, compared across several countries and groups of reference. HOMInG’s objectives are to: 1. Analyze migrant “ways of homing” in a multi-sited and comparative framework, highlighting the distinctive influence of ethnicity and mobility on the home experience. 2. Advance the theoretical connection between home, mobility and circulation, by understanding how (far) the physical, relational and emotional bases of home are reproduced over space, and how (far) pre-existing home cultures are affected by transnational migration. 3. Implement a research design that innovates the comparative study of belonging and place attachment among mobile and sedentary populations. 4. Assess the conditions under which private and public spaces may be more or less conducive to an inclusive home experience – marked by familiarity, security, routine – in migrants’ and natives’ everyday lives. HOMInG breaks new ground in migration, mobility and home studies, by demonstrating how apparently mundane details, such as the ways of experiencing home, provide an original research window into social change in multi-ethnic societies. Based on unprecedented cross-country data, it will enable a fresh understanding of home, as affected by migration."
DomEQUAL,A Global Approach to Paid Domestic Work and Social Inequalities,"How does globalisation impact the construction of social inequality? DomEQUAL tackles this question through a study on paid domestic work (PDW). Of the 52.6 million PDWs in the world today, 43 million are women and 7 million are children. The multidimensional transformations brought about by globalisation with the intensification of international migration, the urbanisation of rural and indigenous populations, and changes in household organisation and welfare regimes have a massive impact on PDWs at the global level. New research possibilities are open since PDW has become an object of global governance. The ILO Convention 189 is the most evident sign of this. For researchers, this has the important effect of making new data and tools for analysis available. DomEQUAL profits from this opportunity to provide a global comparison of PDWs’ social positions, especially in the socio-economic and legal fields. It also provides the opportunity to experiment an ‘intersectionality’ approach to PDW on a large scale. Finally, it analyses which type of global/local actor is more effective in improving the legal framework for PDWs. In so doing, it aims at a theoretical and methodological contribution that goes beyond PDW and addresses the construction of social inequalities within globalisation more generally. This is done through a diachronic comparison (1950s-now) of the changing situation of PDWs in the following countries: Spain, Italy and Germany in Europe. Colombia, Ecuador and Brazil in South America. and India, the Philippines and Taiwan in Asia. These nine countries are interesting cases for comparison because of their different positions within the process of globalisation, the specificities of their socio-cultural contexts, and also because they have all experienced mobilisations for PDWs’ rights. The project will be carried out by the PI and two senior post-doc researchers based in Italy, with the support of nine experts in the selected countries."
RESPONSIVENESS,"The Microfoundations of Authoritarian Responsiveness: E-Participation, Social Unrest and Public Policy in China","China’s success story of the past three decades is seen as an anomaly. Market-based reforms have generated an economic system that can hardly be described as socialist anymore, but the Communist Party of China remains in power. Although social unrest is on the rise, the CCP enjoys the consent of the overwhelming majority of its people. Most agree that China’s economic performance is the key to solving this apparent puzzle, but how can extraordinary high rates of public support be maintained in a country where income inequality is so extreme? We believe that the answer to this question lies in the responsiveness of China’s authoritarian one-party regime to popular demands and grievances, a capability that has so far been attributed only to democratic regimes. We further believe that the rapid improvement of e-participation, the opportunity to evaluate public services on the Internet, has greatly facilitated regime responsiveness - China’s score in the United Nations e-participation index is higher than the European average. We suggest, however, that as the government increasingly calibrates public policy towards satisfying the demand of China’s netizens, the technologically illiterate are forced to express their demands in public protests and other forms of social unrest. The proposed project sheds light on the intended and unintended consequences of enhanced e-participation in China by exploring which social interests China’s rulers incorporate into public policy making, and how these decisions influence the propensity of particular social groups to voice their demands by either participating online or taking to the streets. By exploring the “complex system” in which online complaints, social unrest and public policy interact, the project provides insights into the micro-foundations of regime responsiveness in China. It thereby increases our knowledge of how the CCP seeks to defer the antagonism that prompted the revolutions in Egypt, Tunisia and Syria."
EXPOVIBE,Exposure to Political Violence and Individual Behavior,"This project will explore how exposure to political violence in a civil conflict context impacts upon social, economic and political behavior of individuals. It has three legs. In the first leg I will analyze the association between political and domestic violence. Specifically, I will test the hypothesis that those exposed to political violence are more likely to be perpetrators of domestic violence. In the second leg I will analyze whether exposure to political violence impacts upon economic behavior. Specifically, I will analyze the impact of exposure on risk, time and social preferences, savings behavior, employment, and earnings. Finally, in the third leg I will look into political behavior. Specifically, I will analyze the association between exposure to political violence and political participation and support, political tolerance, ideology, voting behavior, and party choice. The project will make use of a natural experiment setting that the institutional setup and the long-running civil conflict in Turkey create. Turkey has a mandatory military service system that requires each Turkish man, when he comes to age, to serve in the army for about a year. Those drafted are first subject to a basic training program and then, via a lottery, are randomly assigned to military bases all over the country to serve the rest of their terms. This means a young soldier can be sent to a military base in Eastern or Southeastern Turkey where a bloody armed conflict between the Turkish armed forces and the insurgent organization PKK has been going on since August 1984, and thus, can get actively involved in the armed conflict. This is a natural experiment setting that randomly exposes young Turkish males to political violence. In this project I aim to study whether and how that exposure impacts upon social, economic and political behavior of the exposed. To accomplish these goals, two independent, large-n survey studies will be designed and conducted in Turkey."
INTERACT,"INTerEthnic Relationships in contemporAry CommuniTies: How does ethnoracial diversity affect in- and out-group trust, solidarity, and cooperation","The increasingly multiethnic nature of modern societies has spurred academic interest in the consequences of diversity. Recent scholarship has linked ethnoracial diversity to undesirable collective outcomes, e.g., low levels of trust, civic engagement, and social capital. These findings have important policy implications, in part because they resonate with public anxieties about immigration, residential integration, and the role of the welfare state. The proposed research will investigate the micro-mechanisms through which contact promotes or impedes solidarity and cooperation in diverse communities. More generally, this research moves beyond communitarian conceptions of social capital to understand the building blocks of solidarity in contemporary, diverse societies. To investigate the micro-level dynamics that link intergroup contact to solidarity and cooperation, this project takes an innovative field-experimental approach, which moves beyond observational data. In particular, the project uses lab-in-the-field experimental games to assess the dispositional mechanisms – such as generalized altruism, group solidarity, reciprocity, and sanctioning – that bring about solidarity and cooperation in various group settings. This revised version of the proposal addresses all the panel observations and implements changes accordingly. First, I have limited the research to project 3 (P3), and cut projects 1 (P1) and 2 (P2). Second, the duration of the project has been reduced to 48 months. Third, all expenses related to P1 and P2 have been cut."
aidsocpro,Aiding Social Protection: the political economy of externally financing social policy in developing countries,"This research proposal explores the political economy of international development assistance (aid) directed towards social expenditures, examined through the lens of a particular financial quandary that has been ignored in the literature despite having important economic and political repercussions. The quandary is that aid cannot be directly spent on expenditures denominated in domestic currency. Instead, aid needs to be first converted into domestic currency whereas the foreign exchange provided is used for other purposes, resulting in a process prone to complex politics regarding domestic monetary policy and spending commitments. The implications require a serious rethink of many of the accepted premises in the political economy of aid and related literatures. It is urgent to engage in this rethinking given tensions between two dynamics in the current global political economy: a tightening financial cycle facing developing countries versus an increasing emphasis in international development agendas of directing aid towards social expenditures. The financial quandary might exacerbate these tensions, restricting recipient government policy space despite donor commitments of respecting national ownership. The proposed research examines these implications through the emerging social protection agenda among donors, which serves as an ideal policy case given that social protection expenditures are almost entirely based on domestic currency. This will be researched through a mixed-method comparative case study of six developing countries, combining quantitative analysis of balance of payments and financing constraints with qualitative process tracing based on elite interviews and documentary research. The objective is to re-orient our thinking on these issues for a deeper appreciation of the systemic political and economic challenges facing global redistribution towards poorer countries, particularly with respect to the forthcoming Sustainable Development Goals."
HERITAGE,Cultural Heritage and Economic Development in International and European Law,"Can states promote economic development without infringing upon their cultural heritage? Although economic globalization and international economic governance have spurred a more intense dialogue and interaction among nations - potentially promoting cultural diversity and providing the funds to recover and preserve cultural heritage - these phenomena can also jeopardize the cultural wealth of nations. Trade in cultural products can lead to cultural homogenization and even to cultural hegemony. In parallel, foreign direct investments have an unmatched penetrating force with the ultimate capacity of changing landscapes and erasing memory. At the same time, the increase in global trade, economic integration and foreign direct investment has determined the creation of legally binding and highly effective regimes that demand states to promote and facilitate trade and foreign direct investment. Has an international economic culture emerged that emphasizes productivity and economic development at the expense of cultural wealth? Does the existing legal framework adequately protect the cultural wealth of nations vis-à-vis economic globalization? Could existing mechanisms in international and European law constrain negative effects of globalization? HERITAGE aims to map the interaction between economic globalization and each specimen of cultural heritage - world heritage, cultural diversity, intangible cultural heritage, indigenous heritage and underwater cultural heritage - in international and European law by investigating the relevant case law before international courts and tribunals. The study adopts an interdisciplinary approach. the relevant cases will be investigated in consideration of both their legal and cultural relevance. The main outcome of this research project will be a monograph written by the principal investigator to be published by a major international publisher. and a number of articles to be published in major international journals."
DEMSEC,Democratic Secrecy: A Philosophical Study of the Role of Secrecy in Democratic Politics,"Transparency in politics is the mantra of democratic governance. Should state secrecy, such as classified intelligence programs or closed-door political bargaining be abolished? Despite its revered status, many feel that complete transparency would undermine effective functioning of governments. Take the public responses to the Wikileaks disclosures: many of the disclosures were assessed favorably, but few people defended the idea of total transparency that inspired them. If both complete secrecy and complete transparency are to be rejected, what ratio of secrecy and transparency in politics should we seek? Democratic theory leaves this question unanswered: no systematic assessment of the role of secrecy in a democracy is available. This project solves this problem. By employing the tools of analytic political philosophy, social choice and game theory, we develop a theory of democratic secrecy centred around three theses: 1. Secrecy in exercising executive and legislative power can be democratically authorized. 2. Secrecy protects the integrity of democratic decision-making processes. 3. Balancing secrecy and transparency is an exercise in balancing the values underlying democratic authority and democratic decision-making mechanisms. The results of this philosophical study set a new course in democratic theory by demonstrating that democratic governance requires less openness than traditionally assumed. To complement the theory, criteria for political accountability for wielding political secrets and criteria for assessing responsibility for their unauthorized disclosure are designed. Our results have practical relevance: understanding when and why secrecy is morally acceptable may change the policy approach to transparency provisions, and provide a better fit between the “public right to know” and the needs of governments. Scholars from Poland and the Netherlands assess the use of governmental secrecy in these two, respectively old and new, EU member states."
MigrantParents,Reproducing Europe: Migrant Parenting and Questions of Citizenship,"This project is an anthropological study of citizenship in a Europe where the presence of migrants has increasingly come to be seen as a burden or threat. This project examines how citizenship is debated, produced and negotiated in this context. It does so through a multilevel study of debates, interventions and practices related to migrant parenting in Paris, Milan and Amsterdam. The experiences of Egyptian migrant parents – a relatively new North African and (partly) Muslim migrant group – serve as its vantage point. Migrant parenting provides a new and fertile angle to explore questions of citizenship, understood here as membership and participation in the nation. Migrant parents are frequently seen as potential threat to the reproduction of the nation, and may thus be targeted by a variety of citizenship agendas designed to ensure the proper reproduction of citizens. This research examines how migrant parents engage with such agendas. It thereby studies the intersection of 1. political debates regarding migrant parents and the nation, 2. interventions through which states regulate and shape the reproduction of citizens, and 3. everyday interactions in the context of parenting. Theoretically, this research will advance theories of citizenship through its innovative focus on migrant parenting, enabling an understanding of how correspondences between family and nation impact citizenship. It also contributes to citizenship studies through its innovative multilevel analysis, which details how citizenship is produced at the intersection of political debates, institutional interventions, and everyday interactions. Additionally, its comparative design enables an assessment of the impact of particular political debates and institutional arrangements on citizenship in Europe. This study will thereby further our understanding of the complex set of conditions that shape social life in contemporary European cities."
VOICES,Voices Of Individuals: Collectively Exploring Self-determination,"The right to make one’s own decisions and to have these decisions respected by law is a basic human freedom which most adults take for granted. However, for many people with disabilities (especially people with intellectual, psycho-social and other cognitive disabilities) this fundamental right has been denied – informally, in the private sphere, and formally, in the public sphere through States’ laws and policies. Since the entry into force of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, there is an emerging consensus in human rights discourse that all people, regardless of their decision-making skills, should enjoy ‘legal capacity’ on an equal basis—that is, the right to be recognised as a person before the law and the subsequent right to have one’s decisions legally recognised. To date most of the literature on how this right should be realised has been developed by non-disabled scholars without the direct input of people with disabilities themselves. The VOICES project will take a radical approach to develop new law reform ideas based on this concept of ‘universal legal capacity.’ Its primary objective is to develop reform proposals based on the lived experience of disability. The project will support individuals who self-identify as disabled to develop personal narratives about their experiences in exercising, or being denied, legal capacity. Through a collaborative process, legal and social science scholars will then work with people with disabilities to develop their personal narratives to frame and ground concrete proposals for law reform in previously unexplored areas – including consent to sex, contractual capacity, criminal responsibility and consent to medical treatment. In this way, the legitimacy of people with disabilities’ perspectives on the options for law reform will be validated, and this will create a powerful argument for legal change."
CORPNET,"Corporate Network Governance: Power, Ownership and Control in Contemporary Global Capitalism","The character of global business networks has long fascinated but continues to divide scholars of global markets and governance. A well-established perspective looks at the changes in global networks and sees an emerging cohesive transnational capitalist class. However, a rival line of inquiry sees the rise of competing corporate elites. Scholars also disagree on the origins of emergent patterns of corporate networks. Do they reflect institutional preferences of corporate and political elites? Or are they unintended by-products of corporate conduct? Third, there are fundamental differences of opinion on how patterns of global corporate ownership relate to actual power in the governance of such networks. Past research has been unable to adjudicate these debates in part due to insufficient data clarifying the full breadth of corporate interactions globally, and insufficient analytical tools for analysing that breadth. This project seeks to do what has so far eluded existing scholarship: to fully explore the global network of corporate ownership and control as a complex system. Network structures may appear to be the result of a grand design at macro level, but are the outcome of the sum of the actions of a large set of interdependent actors. Using cutting-edge network science methods, the project explores for the first time the largest database on ownership and control covering over 100 million firms. Exploiting the longitudinal richness of the new data in combination with state-of-the-art methods and techniques makes it possible to model and empirically test generating mechanisms that drive network formation. By doing so the project bridges the hitherto disjoint fields of social network studies in socio-economics and political science on the one hand, and the growing body of literature on network science in physics, computer science and complexity studies on the other."
DATACTIVE,Data activism: The politics of big data according to civil society,"With the diffusion of ‘big data’, citizens become increasingly aware of the critical role of information in modern societies. This awareness gives rise to new social practices rooted in technology and data, which I term ‘data activism’. While activists see massive data collection by governments and businesses as a challenge to civil rights, big data also offer new opportunities for collective action. This research will investigate civil society’s engagement with massive data collection by addressing three research questions: How do citizens resist massive data collection by means of technical fixes (re-active data activism)? How do social movements use big data to foster social change (pro-active data activism)? How does data activism affect the dynamics of transnational civil society, and transnational advocacy networks in particular? The project will develop a multidisciplinary conceptual framework integrating social movement studies, science and technology studies and international relations. It will analyze organizational forms, action repertoires and the enabling role of software in data activism, and will identify emerging structures and strategies of transnational advocacy networks. Data will be collected via qualitative (interviews with activists, field observations, infrastructure ethnography on software platforms) and computational methods (such as data mining in online repositories). ‬ ‪This research is groundbreaking in four ways: 1) by analyzing civil society’s engagement with massive data collection, it evaluates risks and promises of big data. 2) by addressing an uncharted but rapidly growing field of human action, it sets the basis for understanding future civic engagement. 3) by integrating adjacent disciplines that seldom interact, it magnifies their ability to understand the interplay between society, information, technology and power. 4) by developing dedicated data collection tools, it adds to methodological innovation in big-data analytics."
FICKLEFORMS,Fickle Formulas. The Political Economy of Macroeconomic Measurement,"Macroeconomic indicators are integral to economic governance. Measurements of growth, unemployment, inflation and public deficits inform policy, for example through growth targets and the inflation-indexation of wages. These indicators tell us “how economies are doing” and citizens often punish politicians who fail to deliver on them. Their air of objectivity notwithstanding, it is far from self-evident how these indicators should be defined and measured. Our choices here have deeply distributional consequences, producing winners and losers, and will shape our future, for example when GDP figures hide the cost of environmental degradation. So why do we measure our economies the way we do? Criticisms of particular measures are hardly new but their real-world effect has been limited. The project therefore asks: which social, political and economic factors shape the formulas used to calculate macroeconomic indicators? Extant research offers detailed histories of statistics, mostly in single countries. But we lack theoretical and empirical tools to describe and explain differences in measurement formulas between countries and over time. FICKLEFORMS will provide such understanding through five sub-projects. The first systematically compares the evolution of four indicators in four central OECD countries: the United Kingdom, the United States, France and Germany. The second analyses the timing and content of statistical harmonization efforts through the United Nations, the IMF and the World Bank. The third constructs a new database of “measures of measures” to quantitatively test hypotheses emerging from the previous sub-projects. The final two sub-projects reach beyond the OECD and study the politics of macroeconomic measurement in China, India, Brazil and South Africa. This project will promote public debate over meaningful measures, allow policy-makers to reflect on current practices, and sensitize academics who use macroeconomic data about their political roots."
PersoNews,"Profiling and targeting news readers – implications for the democratic role of the digital media, user rights and public information policy","In the digital media environment, user attention is scarce and competition for ‘eyeballs’ is fierce. Profiling and targeting readers with customised news and advertisements that match their individual interests is widely seen as a solution. The personalization of news media content enables new financing strategies and means to capture the audience’s attention. But personalisation is also part of a more fundamental paradigm shift in the media’s role from public interest intermediary to personal information coach. This research will answer critical questions about the implications for individual users and contribute to a new normative theory of the role of personalised media in a democratic society. To do so, this project integrates legal research, communication sciences and political sciences, undertakes comparative, normative and evidence-based research, and carries out experiments, interviews and a survey. Two communication science postdocs will conduct empirical research into user concerns, the conditions that affect users’ acceptance of media personalisation (postdoc 1), and how personalisation affects journalistic practices and ethics (postdoc 2). Informed by these insights, two PhD students will scrutinise the legal framework and answer important questions about the legal protection of the public’s trust in editorial integrity (PhD 1) and autonomous, non-discriminatory information access (PhD 2). The PI will develop a normative framework of personalised media, based on the empirical research and political theories about the democratic role of the media. This responds to the criticism that existing theories are increasingly disconnected from the realities of digital media and their distinct contribution to democratic and participatory processes. The project will explore the potential of personalisation to expose citizens to more relevant or diverse content, thus reversing widespread concerns about information overload, filter bubbles and selective exposure."
EUBorderCare,"Intimate Encounters in EU Borderlands: Migrant Maternity, Sovereignty and the Politics of Care on Europe’s Peripheries","EU Border Care is a comparative study of the politics of maternity care among undocumented migrants on the EU’s peripheries. Empirical analysis of personal and institutional relations of care and control in the context of pregnancy and childbirth will support an innovative critique of the moral rationale underpinning healthcare delivery and migration governance in some of Europe’s most densely crossed borderlands in France, Greece, Italy and Spain. Unlike other categories of migrants, undocumented pregnant women are a growing phenomenon, yet few social science or public health studies address EU migrant maternity care. This subject has urgent implications: whilst recent geopolitical events in North Africa and the Middle East have triggered a quantifiable increase in pregnant women entering the EU in an irregular situation, poor maternal health indicators among such women represent ethical and medical challenges to which frontline maternity services located in EU borderlands have to respond, often with little preparation or support from national and European central authorities. Grounded in long-term ethnographic fieldwork in maternity wards located in French Guiana and Mayotte (Overseas France), the North Aegean and Attica (Greece), Sicily (Italy), and Ceuta and Melilla (Spain), my project will trace the networks of maternity care delivery in peripheries facing an increase of immigration flows, and characterised by structural social and economic underinvestment. My team will investigate migrant maternity from three interlinked research perspectives: migrant women, healthcare delivery staff, and regional institutional agencies. Empirical and desk research, combined with creative audio-visual methods, will document migrant maternity on EU borderlands to address wider questions about identity and belonging, citizenship and sovereignty, and humanitarianism and universalism in Europe today."
VITAL,The Vitality of Disease - Quality of Life in the Making,"Epidemiological reports from around the world suggest that more people than ever before are living with (especially chronic) diseases. As a consequence, sustained efforts to reduce morbidity and mortality rates have been joined by systematised efforts to improve the lives – the quality of life – of those living with disease in ways that are measurable and auditable. VITAL will focus on the making of ‘quality of life’. While social studies of medicine have of late been marked by a ‘bio-turn’, it is apparent that within contemporary medicine, life is envisaged as much more than cellular and molecular activity. it is also a social activity and a personal experience. Not only is life sustained, it is also lived. In recent decades, morbid living – living with disease – has come to be the object of novel forms of knowledge, expertise, measurement and management while also generating new medical practices and attendant ways of relating to oneself. VITAL suggests a shift in attention from the ways in which the social sciences have previously studied morbid living and related issues of quality of life. Rather than continue longstanding efforts to understand how people cope with disease or to refine definitions and instruments for measuring the quality of life of the sick, in VITAL we will empirically study the co-production of ‘quality of life’ within healthcare through four ethnographically-grounded studies of how ‘quality of life’ is assembled, mobilised, negotiated and practiced in concrete medical settings. The four studies will focus on how knowledge about living with disease is assembled and mobilised, on the one hand, and how morbid living is negotiated and practiced on the other. The key outcomes of VITAL will be theoretical advancement of understandings of vitality in the 21st century beyond molecular biology and methodological innovation to facilitate empirical study of co-production processes that involve social science knowledge and practice."
GREYZONE,Illuminating the 'Grey Zone': Addressing Complex Complicity in Human Rights Violations,"The grey zone of bystanders, collaborators and beneficiaries of violence escapes the scope of main Transitional Justice (TJ) institutions and poses tough questions for scholars and architects of post-conflict societies. This interdisciplinary project shifts the focus of academic and political debates by pursuing three objectives: conceptually, it departs from the dominant victim-perpetrator paradigm and theorises the many faces in the grey zone by analysing the interplay between structure and agency. normatively, it argues that no account of TJ is complete without engaging the grey zone. empirically, it tests if, in tackling the grey zone, cinematographic and literary representations can supplement typical TJ mechanisms (trials, truth commissions, lustration). Four cases are analysed: authoritarianism plus military occupation (Vichy France), apartheid (South Africa), totalitarianism (Romania 1945–1989) and military dictatorship (Argentina 1976–1983). The cases provide a variety of contexts of complicity and feature the most frequently used TJ mechanisms. They serve to a) examine the relationship between the official story emerging from state-orchestrated TJ mechanisms and artistic narratives of complicity. b) contextually distinguish disclosive from obscuring artistic representations of the grey zone. c) explore the contribution of these representations to TJ efforts by studying their effect on public debates about—and institutional responses to—the past. Working at the frontiers between political science, philosophy, history, law, literature and cinema, this pioneering project has critical and institutional impact. Critically, it discloses the limits of current TJ theory and practice by emphasising the negative political effects of ignoring general complicity in violence. Institutionally, it seeks to enrich the toolkit of scholars and practitioners by pointing to the potential use of cinema and literature in civic education aimed at deterrence and reconciliation."
ENHANCEDQMMR,Enhanced Qualitative and Multi-Method Research in Political Science,"Over the last 20 years, qualitative methods in political science have developed rapidly on three dimen-sions. First, set theory was formulated as an alternative to what is called the quantitative worldview. Second, process tracing for the analysis of mechanisms evolved as a complement to the estimation of marginal effects. Process tracing has also been tied to Bayesianism as opposed to frequentism. Third, process tracing became an element of multi-method research (MMR), integrating it with frequentist statistics or Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA). An important element of the development of qualitative methods is its contrast with quantitative methods. At the same time, quantitative researchers critically commented on that development. The constant exchange has contributed to the progress of qualitative methods, but the debate has reached an impasse in some respects, or has pursued one line of development while neglecting others. Building on state-of-the-art qualitative methods, ENHANCEDQMMR seeks to overcome this impasse and to explore new ground.It makes four significant contributions to the progress of standalone qualitative methods and as part of MMR. First, it examines experimentally how researchers decide between a set-relational and correlational view on causation and whether they can realize designs in accord with their initial decision. Second, it develops tools for sensitivity analyses, diagnostics, and the modeling of diverse data structures via QCA for strengthening QCA-based inference. Third, it com-pares the performance of QCA and regression analyses under simulated data-generating processes with the goal of generating comparative diagnostics, possibly allowing one to adjudicate between both methods in observational research. Fourth, it formulates standards for Bayesian MMR by combining Bayesian process tracing with Bayesian statistics and Bayesian QCA, respectively. The insights of the project will be implemented in freely available software."
EUTHORITY,Conflict and Cooperation in the EU Heterarchical Legal System,"Supranational legal regimes are increasingly enforced by multi-level, non-hierarchical court systems, in which judges at the upper, supranational echelon do not have the power to reverse domestic court decisions. Yet the incentives and dynamics that shape the complex patterns of conflict and cooperation observed in the most important of all such court structures, the EU legal system, are still poorly understood. To what extent are domestic courts able to negotiate the terms of their cooperation with the Court of Justice? How do national courts differ in that respect? Are the non-compliance threats issued by domestic courts all equally credible? Do the rare cases where these threats have been put to execution pose a systemic risk to the authority of EU law? How are the domestic courts’ incentives to cooperate with EU judges affected by the sort of political backsliding witnessed in Hungary and Romania in recent years? Our interdisciplinary research project addresses these puzzles of legal integration with the avowed aim of helping judges and policy-makers make more informed choices when faced with compliance problems in the judicial realm. Grounded in a general theory of judicial behaviour, our generic hypothesis is that the authority of EU law at domestic level is determined by domestic politics as well as by judicial attitudes towards integration. EUTHORITY seeks to refine this hypothesis using game theoretic modelling to analyse strategic interactions among the Court of Justice and domestic courts and politicians. Theory-building combines with a large-scale data-collection effort. We undertake to compile longitudinal data on the institutional characteristics and doctrinal responses to legal integration of 68 domestic apex courts across the EU 28 Member States. With a view to construct an annual, court-specific index of legal integration, we also conduct an expert survey asking academic lawyers and practitioners to assess their courts' attitudes towards EU law."
Intimacy,Doing Intimacy: A Multi-sited Ethnography of Modern Chinese Family Life,"Families in Western countries have received a great deal of attention from social scientists but there is less information on family life in other regions of the world. Given its growing rapidly in global influence, China represents a crucial region for sociological advancement and understanding. There have been profound changes in the Chinese family over the last century as a result of industrialization, urbanization, the influence of the West and the political interventions carried out by the Communist Party since 1949. Existing scholarship has shown how the structure and function of Chinese families have adapted to changing political and economic circumstances but little is known about the changes in intimate spheres of Chinese families. This project will approach the subject of modern Chinese family life from an unconventional angle, analysing it as a process of practices and experiences. By setting a new agenda that moves from structures of family relationships to the quality of relationships and through examining ‘doing intimacy’, this project will take a closer, fresher, critical look at the Chinese family dynamics as they are lived. Informed by the emerging literature on gender, intimacy and modernity, this project will examine intergenerational relations as well as gender and sexual relations in the family. Is there an intimate revolution taking place? How is ‘modernity’/’tradition’ closely linked with practices of intimacy? To what extent can doing intimacy be a site of empowerment/domination for women? What will the study of Chinese families tell us about agency and local/global change? Through a multi-sited ethnography (mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan), this study will also compare practices of intimacy in various sites and examine whether/how they are by-products of particular socio-cultural configurations. It will identify the extent to which changes in Chinese families mirror changes in the West and the factors that contribute to these changes."
Highland Connections,Remoteness and Connectivity: Highland Asia in the World,"Asian highlands from the Afghan Pamir to Kashmir, Tibet and Northeast India are of great geopolitical concern. Remote, yet thoroughly connected to the outside world, they figure in public debate alternately as sanctuaries for transnational insurgents, as trafficking routes in the global drug and wildlife trade, and as realms of authentic tribal culture. Though making headlines around the globe as independent cases, we lack a conceptual understanding of their entanglements, role and position in a globally connected world. The aim of this project is to lay the conceptual groundwork for a new apprehension of the positionality of remote areas around the globe. It rests on the hypothesis that remoteness and connectivity are not two independent features but constitute each other in particular ways. My objective is to explore the nexus of remoteness and connectivity – a fundamental dynamic that has never been studied from a comparative, transnational perspective. Highland Asia, the chosen study area spanning the mountain regions between Pamir and Eastern Himalaya, transcends the boundaries of nation-states and area studies. It offers a unique vantage point to reveal a bigger picture. The project is timely. 25 years after the end of the Cold War, Highland Asia experiences a rapid increase in transnational exchange. Old trade routes closed for generations are being re-opened and the quest for natural resources and new markets attracts capital and new actors to the highlands. The hotspots of tension at the edge of Asia’s rising powers are becoming junctures of exchange. The project studies this ongoing but little understood transformation in real time. The project will be carried out by an international team of four researchers at LMU Munich. Interdisciplinary in outlook but grounded in anthropology, 52 months of fieldwork will be conducted in 4 transnational settings in Highland Asia. Results will be published in 2 edited collections, 20 papers, and individual monographs."
LITTLE TOOLS,Enacting the Good Economy: Biocapitalization and the little tools of valuation,"What shall we live off in the future? Where will our food come from, and what will form the basis for our economies? A so-called “blue revolution”, where fish become farmed rather than caught, is increasingly presented as an answer to the above questions. This transformation of the economy exemplifies ongoing efforts to produce new forms of capital out of the ordering and reordering of life. These processes are intimately related to the expanding life sciences, the bioeconomy and what is sometimes called new forms of biocapital. But how do such large transformations take place in actual practice, and by which means? This project argues that if we are to understand such major transformations we need to study “little tools”, that is, material-semiotic entities that carefully modify and work upon bodies, markets and science. Emerging bioeconomies are expected not only to produce economic value but also to enact values in other ways that contribute to what this project refers to as “the good economy”. Such values include enabling sustainable fisheries, secure animal welfare or sustainable growth. The main hypothesis of the current project is that the enactment of the good economy can be studied by valuation practices performed by material-semiotic little tools. The project will explore this hypothesis at multiple sites for biocapitalization: science, the market, policy and funding institutions. This project will focus on how these interact and encounter one another. The aim is twofold: first, to provide new empirical insights about how biocapitalization processes are enacted in practice and at strategic sites, using cross-disciplinary methods from actor-network theory, the humanities and economic sociology. second to contribute analytically and methodologically to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) by drawing on resources from economic sociology and the humanities in order to provide an analytical framework for comprehending biocapitalization practices."
iLABOUR,"Online Labour: The Construction of Labour Markets, Institutions and Movements on the Internet","World Bank, EC Joint Research Centre, and other bodies have recently highlighted the potential of online labour markets to boost employment and economic growth. While national job markets have stagnated, online labour markets that connect firms with knowledge and service workers around the world have grown up to 60% a year. An overlooked aspect of these markets is that they extricate workers and employers from national institutional frameworks, such as employment law and collective bargaining, and instead impose their own, technologically enforced institutions. For example, a leading marketplace recently instated a global minimum wage of 4.00 USD/h. With over 540,000 employers and 4,000,000 registered workers in 180 countries, this Californian company is making critical labour policy decisions that influence businesses and individuals from Berlin to Manila. The objective of this project is to lay bare the politics and institutions of these next-generation labour markets promoted with discourses of technological progress. Whose interests find expression in their institutions? Some online workers have begun to organize transnationally with the help of digital media. How do online labour movements emerge and assert power on these markets? And finally, to what extent are these relations still reducible to struggles between capital and labour, rather than more ambiguous networked models of production? We will tackle these questions through a combination of conventional social research methods and innovative Internet research methods, on both virtual research sites (online labour markets and workers' online communities) and physical research sites (market operators' premises and worker gatherings). We survey, interview, and observe designers and workers to reconstruct processes through which online markets, institutions, and movements are shaped, and scrape online data to quantify their influence. The results will open up important new vistas in labour policy debate."
ToxicExpertise,Toxic Expertise: Environmental Justice and the Global Petrochemical Industry,"This research project critically examines ‘toxic expertise’, the contested politics of making scientific claims about the health impacts of toxic pollution. Toxic expertise has a double meaning: scientific expertise about the effects of toxic pollution, and the toxic nature of expertise that is used to justify a lack of corporate social responsibility. The research focuses on the global petrochemical industry as a significant but controversial source of toxic pollution, with unequal regulations and risks across different countries and populations. Debates about the global petrochemical industry reflect conflicting interests between jobs, prosperity, and health. This research contributes to interdisciplinary social scientific research on science and technology, environmental justice movements, and the uneven geography of capitalism. In particular, it develops sociological arguments that scientific ‘expertise’ is inherently political and socially constructed. This mixed method comparative research will be conducted in three stages. The first stage will examine toxic expertise in the leading global petrochemical companies and environmental non-governmental organisations in Western Europe, North America, and China. The second stage will focus on in-depth case studies in the United States and China, two of the top petrochemical producers in the world. The third stage will develop an international public resource of toxic expertise to address practical challenges of capacity and scale inherent within both dominant and citizen-led epidemiology, by developing accessible information and tools for understanding, monitoring, and reporting toxic pollutants and their health impacts. The project offers the first systematic sociological analysis of the global petrochemical industry in relation to environmental justice, responding to calls within critical social science for the democratisation of science which highlight the need for greater accountability and transparency."
SUSTAINABLEOCEAN,Accommodating New Interests at Sea: Legal Tools for Sustainable Ocean Governance,"This research project will develop a theoretical framework and legal tools to aid scholars and stakeholders (law and policy-makers, private investors, environmental NGOs) in managing competing interests in the offshore economic sector. The offshore sector is expanding and activities at sea are increasing (e.g., deep seabed mining, oil and gas extraction, renewable energy technologies, etc.). This situation threatens the health of the marine environment and its biodiversity. It also impacts traditional uses of the sea, such as navigation and fishing. New activities pose major challenges for the sustainable management of the oceans, and they highlight competing interests that the law needs to accommodate, such as: - protecting the marine environment and conserving its biodiversity. - mitigating climate change effects. - guaranteeing the continuity of the relevant economic activities. - guaranteeing energy efficiency and security. and - protecting the rights of local communities and populations. This project will answer the following research question: how can the law contribute to the sustainable use of the oceans and strike a balance between competing interests at sea? The law pertaining to ocean governance is fragmented into regimes that are imbued by different interests. The project will begin by analysing three legal frameworks, which are the most relevant for the offshore industry: the law of the sea, climate change law and energy law. It will focus on the operation of the offshore industry and on the competing interests, which have influenced the respective fields of law. This will allow identifying patterns of regime interaction and assessing their impact on the different uses of the sea. The research will ultimately offer a theory of interest- and regime-interaction in ocean governance and thus create a comprehensive framework for the development of legal tools(briefs, recommendation, which will contribute to sustainable ocean governance."
RATIMED,"Re-Assembling Tibetan Medicine: The formation of a transnational Sowa Rigpa industry in contemporary India, China, Mongolia and Bhutan","“Traditional medicine” has recently emerged from a highly marginalized position in many parts of the world to become a rapidly expanding and highly innovative multi-billion dollar global industry. However, despite growing academic, economic and public interest in the “traditional” pharmaceutical industry, we know little about its larger dynamics, shape, and wider socio-economic and public health implications. The proposed 5-year interdisciplinary study of the emergent transnational Tibetan medicine (or “Sowa Rigpa”) industry in India, China, Mongolia and Bhutan aims to fill this gap. The Sowa Rigpa industry, in which Tibetan medicine is transformed into a mass-produced commodity for domestic and international markets, is a particularly illustrative and timely case of traditional medicine's development. It is illustrative because it reflects the dynamics of the traditional pharma industry at large, and it is timely because Tibetan medicine’s industrialization and pharmaceuticalization has only begun during the last decade, enabling this study to investigate its formation in real time. Introducing the concept of the pharmaceutical assemblage,the proposed project will break new ground by being the first comprehensive, large-scale, interdisciplinary study of Sowa Rigpa in a transnational context. It will apply an innovative interdisciplinary approach to generate a big picture of this industry and unprecedented insights into the global traditional pharma market, which despite its growing relevance and popularity remains poorly understood. This project will be based at the AAS’s Institute for Social Anthropology, carried out by an international team of 4 post-doctoral researchers, and involve 54 months of multi-sited field research. Besides numerous publications, 2 international workshops and 1 conference will be organized to present the results. While interdisciplinary, the research will be grounded in the field of medical and socio-cultural anthropology."
GLOBALMED,Artemisinin-based combination therapy: an illustration of the global pharmaceutical drug market in Asia and Africa,"Pharmaceutical drugs provide an ideal window into studying contemporary societies. With dimensions that are simultaneously scientific, therapeutic, popular and commercial, these drugs are central to various issues. ACTs, the new recommended treatment for malaria in Africa, crystallize these issues and provide a case study to investigate the global drug market. This project proposes to use ACTs as a lens to study the realities affecting this market, both in terms of supply and demand in two African countries where the pharmaceutical systems differ significantly. This will involve analyzing the globalizing processes affecting drugs in Benin and Ghana and to study their consequences on public health. To further compare the drug systems and to address the serious issue of the spread of resistances to ACTs from Asia to Africa, the project also proposes conducting a study on the drug system in Cambodia. The central discipline is anthropology, which is extremely relevant to the study of formal and informal pharmaceutical supply and to the analysis of drug use (WP1 and WP2). However, since a multidisciplinary approach is advised for drug studies, the PI will work with an epidemiologist who will study the scope of ACT consumption (WP3) and a sociologist specializing in pharmaceutical legislation who will analyze local production and ACT regulations (WP4). Opening into Asia will occur through WP5. A WP6 is devoted to project management, dissemination of results, organizing two symposiums and institutional twofold impacts: (1) to foster reflection so that more efficient pharmaceutical systems are established in Africa, and (2) to provide critical information to prevent the spread of resistances to ACTs from Asia to Africa. The project includes a substantial training component: 8 master students, 2 PhD and 1 post-doct. The PI’s skills in methodology and theory and the solid partnerships she has developed in Benin and Ghana will support the project’s feasibility."
GRASSROOTSMOBILISE,Directions in Religious Pluralism in Europe: Examining Grassroots Mobilisations in Europe in the Shadow of European Court of Human Rights Religious Freedom Jurisprudence,"The European public square has, in the last twenty years and increasingly so, been inundated with controversies around the place of religion in the public sphere. Issues such as freedom of religious expression, freedom of speech v. blasphemy, and the public display of religious symbols loom large in the workplace, in schools, in media coverage etc., at the local, national, and supranational level. The presence of Islam has been a catalyst for many debates on religion in Europe, but these have now grown to encompass much broader assumptions about the nature of religious communities, their relationship to state institutions, and the place of minority religious communities in society. Against this backdrop the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) adds its own voice and significantly influences the terms of the debates. This project examines the domestic impact of the ECtHR religion case law: it explores the mobilisation of local and national level actors in the wake of a number of high-profile ECtHR religious freedom cases in order to determine the nature and extent of European juridical influence on religious pluralism. In light of scholarly debates questioning the direct effects of courts, the project probes developments that take place ‘in the shadow’ of the Court. It engages especially with the extent to which court decisions define the ‘political opportunity structures’ and the discursive frameworks within which citizens act. What is the aftermath of the Court’s religion jurisprudence in terms of its applications at the grassroots level? The question is important because ECtHR case law will shape, to a large extent, both local and national level case law and – less conspicuously but no less importantly – grassroots developments in the promotion of or resistance to religious pluralism. Both the latter will, in turn, influence the future of the ECtHR caseload. The project will thus impart rare insight into directions being taken in religious pluralism in Europe."
Authoritarianism2.0:,"Authoritarianism2.0: The Internet, Political Discussion, and Authoritarian Rule in China","I suggest that perceptions of diversity and disagreement voiced in the on-line political discussion may play a key role in mobilizing citizens to voice their views and take action in authoritarian regimes. The empirical focus is the Chinese Internet. Subjective perceptions of group discussion among participants can significantly differ from the objective content of the discussion. These perceptions can have an independent effect on political engagement. Novel is also that I will study which technological settings (blogs, Weibo (Twitter), public hearings, etc) facilitate these perceptions. I will address these novel issues by specifying the conditions and causal mechanisms that facilitate the rise of online public opinion. As an expansion to prior work, I will study passive in addition to active participants in online discussion. This is of particular interest because passive participants outnumber active participants. My overall aim is to deepen our knowledge of how participants experience online political discussion in stabilizing or destabilizing authoritarian rule. To this end, I propose to work with one post-doc and two PhD research assistants on four objectives: Objective 1 is to explore what kinds of people engage in online discussions and differences between active and passive participants. Objective 2 is to understand how the technological settings that create the conditions for online discussion differ from each other. Objective 3 is to assess how active and passive participants see the diversity and disagreement in the discussion in these settings. Objective 4 is to assess whether citizens take action upon online political discussion depending on how they see it. I will produce the first nationally representative survey on the experiences of participants in online political discussion in China. In addition to academics, this knowledge is of interest to policy-makers, professionals, and journalists aiming to understand authoritarian politics and media"
FFP,Families and food poverty in three European Countries in an Age of Austerity,"Food poverty in the global North is emerging as an urgent social and moral concern, increasingly recognized as a central issue in the field of health inequalities in industrialized countries. With widening income disparity in Austerity Europe and ‘the end of cheap food’, these effects are being exacerbated. International media report an increase in the number of children arriving at school hungry, a dramatic rise in the number of food banks handing out food parcels to families and parents forced to choose between ‘heating and eating’. However, little is known about how food practices are negotiated in low-income families, children’s and young people’s perspectives of food poverty and how it affects their lives, or how food poverty manifests and is addressed in different places. The proposed interdisciplinary, ambitious and innovative study will answer such questions, breaking new ground by: a) applying a mixed method international comparative case study design to the study of household food poverty b) including the experiences of children and young people using both extensive and intensive data and c) drawing on methodological developments in the sociology of food and consumption to elucidate habitual behaviour. Providing for ‘a contrast of contexts’ in relation to conditions of austerity, the study focuses on Portugal, where poor families with children have been most affected by economic retrenchment, the UK, which is experiencing substantial cuts in benefits to poor families, and Norway which, in comparison with most societies, is highly egalitarian and has not been subject to austerity measures. Building on the Principal Investigator’s (PI’s) current mixed-methods UK research on families, food and paid work, the project will develop the PI’s research skills, publication record and international reputation. Engaging academic and non-academic beneficiaries at various stages of analysis and dissemination the study will achieve societal as well as scientific impact."
DEPORT REGIMES,The Social Life of State Deportation Regimes: A Comparative Study of the Implementation Interface,"The deportation of irregular migrants is a burning issue in public debates all around the world. Most states invest heavily in effective deportation regimes, but when it comes to implementation, deportation regimes are notorious for not achieving their declared goals. Everywhere, marked discrepancies persist between deportation policies and actual practices of deportation. This project compares the implementation of deportation regimes in four different states – Israel, Greece, Spain and Ecuador – in order to provide a closely researched assessment of implementation practices. It interrogates a core assumption in much of the scholarly literature on the “deportation turn”, namely, that there is a global convergence of state deportation regimes. The project adds a crucial – yet, so far underexplored – perspective on irregular migration: the interface of street-level state agents and civil-society actors in shaping practices of deportation. Existing studies look either at the “top level” of the state (policies, laws, procedures, etc.), or at the “underground level” of its “victims” (irregular migrants’ survival strategies, trafficking networks, etc.). This project privileges the “meso level” of the deportation regime, bringing to light the agency of those who exercise discretion in interpreting laws and policies at the “implementation interface”. It makes an original contribution to the anthropology of the state, by demonstrating that the territorial sovereignty of states is constantly renegotiated at this level. The project will produce knowledge on the dilemmas, tactics and occasional alliances of those who carry out and those who obstruct deportation regimes. It will provide new insights into actors’ motivations and worldviews, and explore the dynamics of both “implementation deficits” and “implementation surpluses”. The fine-grained comparative methodology is aimed at producing findings that will be of theoretical significance and of vital importance for policymakers, street-level agents and civil-society actors in dealing with the realities of irregular migration in the 21st century."
SECURCIT,Transforming Citizenship through Hybrid Governance: The Impacts of Public-Private Security Assemblages,"This project is an anthropological study of how citizenship is being reconfigured through hybrid forms of governance. It will research these transformations by focusing on public-private ‘security assemblages’, with particular emphasis on the role of the private security industry. Much recent scholarly debate has focused on shifting modes of governance in a context of neoliberal globalization. Specific attention has focused on how governance is increasingly achieved through networks or assemblages of state, corporate and voluntary actors. Such assemblages of state and non-state actors blur the lines between public and private, and between local, national and transnational. This research will extend this debate by investigating the implications this form of governance has for how different groups enact and experience citizenship, concentrating on public-private security assemblages as hybrid, multi-scalar governance structures. It will examine how forms of ‘differentiated citizenship’ are produced, and how political subjectivities shift, as a result of these forms of security governance. These transformations in citizenship will be analyzed through a multi-sited, comparative analysis of security assemblages in Jerusalem (Israel), Kingston (Jamaica) and Nairobi (Kenya). The project will research the composition, operation and regulation of public-private security assemblages, with special attention to the global mobilities of security experts and expertise. In each setting, the project will study the practices and discourses that structure relations between state and non-state security providers, clients and those seen as threats. It will focus on the ‘security encounter’ between these different actors, in which new social relationships and subjectivities are produced. The project is expected to lead to the development of an anthropological theory of security governance with both theoretical and applied relevance."
INTIMATE,"Citizenship, Care and Choice: The Micropolitics of Intimacy in Southern Europe","Changes in personal life in recent decades illustrate significant socio-cultural transformations. However, the focus of mainstream sociological literature has been the heterosexual, monogamic and reproductive couple, with little research exploring non-conventional intimacy in Southern Europe. INTIMATE’s main aim is to contribute to legal, policy and cultural innovation through the findings of a comparative, empirically-grounded, research project designed to rethink citizenship, care and choice from the point of view of 'non-standard intimacies' (Berlant and Warner, 2000) in 3 contrasting Southern European countries: Italy, Portugal and Spain. Guided by the fundamental sociological question of how change takes place and, concomitantly, how law and social policy adjust to and/or shape the practices and expectations of individuals concerning personal life, this research will address intimacy from the perspective of those on the margins of social, legal and policy concerns in Southern Europe – lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and transgendered people. INTIMATE is based on 3 strands – Strand 1: the micropolitics of partnering. Strand 2: the micropolitics of parenting. and Strand 3: the micropolitics of friendship. The notion of micropolitics enables a double focus on everyday practices and expectations (biographic dimension) within the wider contextual framework of law and social policy (socio-legal dimension). This qualitative research involves conducting 6 cross-national qualitative studies across the strands of partnering, parenting and friendship in each of the chosen countries. Topics covered are lesbian coupledom, polyamorous relationships, assisted conception and surrogacy, naming a child, transgender and care, and living with friends in adult life. Expected results include a range of both international and national publications targeting academia and beyond, thematic conferences and participatory workshops, policy briefs, media briefs and an interactive website."
STATORG,"State Encroachment on Civil Society? A Comparative Study of Parties, Interest Groups and Welfare-Providing Organizations in Contemporary Democracies","This interdisciplinary project compares the regulatory frameworks governing membership-based, voluntary organizations (VOs) in long-lived democracies and assesses how these frameworks affect VOs’ operations. It studies interest groups, parties and welfare-providers as three VO types interacting with the state at different stages of the political process. State control over organized civil society is at odds with pluralist values and supposed to weaken VOs’ linkages to citizens. Simultaneously, specialist literatures in political science and sociology point to ‘their’ VOs’ entanglement with the state, while comparative legal and public policy scholars note that governments, in recent reforms, increased their control over which VOs receive funds and how funds can be used. In times of austerity, welfare state retrenchment and declining trust in elected institutions the regulatory frameworks governing VOs are changing, deeply affecting organizational life in a democracy. Only an up-to-date overview of current frameworks allows us to examine whether close state-voluntary relations compromise VO autonomy and reduce VOs’ beneficial effects for democracy. This project tackles these important issues through two modules integrated through a mixed methods design. Module 1 develops an analytical framework to compare the regulation of VOs cross-nationally and applies it to 19 long-lived democracies. Based on this mapping, it specifies and theorizes distinct normative conceptions of state-voluntary relations underpinning democracies. Offering a new approach to VO development, Module 2 studies qualitatively (through in-depth interviews and document analysis) how individual VOs adapt to ‘most different’ regimes - each regime representative of one state-voluntary conception identified in Module 1-, while testing quantitatively (through event history analysis) how far the features that VOs acquire in this process affect their likelihood to survive under varying regulatory conditions."
CONNECTORS,Connectors – an international study into the development of children’s everyday practices of participation in circuits of social action,"Participation – defined in this project as the social practice of engaging in personal and social change – links private and public life, biography and history, and forms a mechanism for social action. Twenty years after the ratification of the United Nations Convention for the Rights of the Child (1989) the international community is no closer to identifying what constitutes a ‘good enough’ model for understanding and supporting the development of children’s participation in public life. The project asks game changing questions about the emergence of children’s orientation towards social action through qualitative, longitudinal and cross-national research. Building on biographical interviews with children, relational and geographical mapping techniques, selective participant-observation with children, and children social research workshops in three cities (London, Athens, Mumbai), the project examines the meaning of personal and social change in middle childhood (6-11 year olds), the circuits of social action that children tap into in an attempt to make changes real, the extent to which privilege, marginalization and economic crisis shape children’s practices of participation, and the ways in which encounters with difference (gender, ethnicity, race, religion) challenge children’s orientation towards social action. By sampling children from a diverse cross-section of each city the project will collect and follow a total of 100 children over a five-year period. The project will provide a rich data sources for making within and between country comparisons and in doing so enable the development a theoretical paradigm for understanding children’s participation that is derived from the bottom-up, that is generated in diverse settings, including non-Western, and that takes advantage of the current rupture to established socio-economic realities to ask questions about the future of social action."
RATE,Repression and the Escalation of Conflict,"The objective of this project is to uncover and explain the escalation and non-escalation of repression and intra-state armed conflict by analyzing how characteristics of the government and its formal and informal security apparatus shape the dynamics of such violence, paying particular attention to the role of monitoring and accountability. RATE analyzes when and under what conditions what types of human rights violations lead to the escalation or deterrence of further repression and armed conflict. Although there has been substantial increase in research on civil war, we know surprisingly little about the dynamics that escalate armed conflict within country-borders and those that prevent an escalation and what role human rights violations and informal armed actors play in those dynamics. While civil wars are a relatively rare occurrence, repression and human rights violations are not. What can this tell us about the link between human rights violations and repression? What leads to the escalation of political violence, increasing the severity and breadth of repression? What hampers the escalation of repression into civil war? Does the avoidance of civil war come at the cost of increased repression? The proposed project produces new data on personal integrity rights and civil liberties, disaggregated by type, intensity, perpetrator, as well as time and space, and on pro-government militias to investigate the conditions under which repression escalates and how monitoring and accountability of formal and particularly informal armed actors affect these escalation processes. It analyzes whether particular human rights violations prevent the escalation of violence by compromising the personal security of the people living in that country. An exploratory case study and agent-based models will be used to refine the theoretical argument, which will then be tested on the new data with cross-national quantitative analyses and three qualitative comparative case studies."
CSIASC,Changing Structures of Islamic Authority and Consequences for Social Change: A Transnational Review,"Research on Muslims in Europe or in the Muslim majority countries has since September 11, mainly focused on understanding the causes of religious radicalization. Largely ignored in the public debates, as well as in academic scholarship, is recognition of the rapid growth in a number of prominent initiatives emerging within Muslims in the west that are aimed at initiating intellectual revival within Islam. Drawing inspiration from the thinkers such as Al-Ghazali or Ibn-Rushd (associated with the ‘rationalist tradition’ in Islam), the Muslim intellectuals and scholars at the center of this movement for intellectual revival in Islam are arguing for ‘indigenizing Islam in the West.’ This project is aimed at understanding the emergence and growth of this movement, the methodology different actors within this movement adopt to initiate reform while remaining loyal to the Islamic ethical spirit, and the implications of these attempts at intellectual reform for individual behavior and social change within Muslims in the west as well as in Muslim majority countries. The project will situate the emergence of this movement within the broader shifts being witnessed in the traditional structures of Islamic authority— such as Al-Azhar University, Dar-ul Uloom, Deoband, Diyanat, and Al-Medina University— that dominate the teaching and interpretation of Islam globally but are under pressure to reform. By developing detailed ethnographic accounts of these new and old institutions of Islamic authority, examining the intellectual discourse of their scholars, observing the argumentations through which they socially advance their conception of Islam, and analyzing how these discourses impact real life choices, this project will shed light on the complexity of Islamic thought and changes in contemporary Muslim societies. It will also highlight the spaces that are emerging for engagement between the Islamic and western tradition and inform theory of religious behavior."
GeoNet,Internet Geographies: Changing Connectivities and the Potentials of Sub-Saharan Africa's Knowledge Economy,"Until recently, access to telecommunication technologies was out of reach for all but the most privileged citizens in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). However, recent radical changes that have connected hundreds of millions have encouraged politicians, journalists, academics, and citizens to speak of an IT-fuelled economic revolution happening on the continent. Many see potentials to move away from primary industries and towards a focus on quaternary and quinary sectors (the knowledge-based parts of the economy). Yet, it remains that there is surprisingly little research into the emergence of a new knowledge economy in Africa. As such, it is precisely now that we urgently need groundbreaking frontier research to understand precisely what impacts are observable, who benefits, and how these changes match up to our expectations for change. We should therefore ask if we are seeing a new era of development on the continent fuelled by ICTs, or whether SSA’s engagement with the global knowledge economy continues to be on terms that reinforce dependence, underdevelopment, and economic extraversion. This research project tackles this broad line of inquiry by focusing on the geographies, causes, and effects of SSA’s emerging knowledge economies at this crucial moment of change. We do so through three key research contexts: economic geographies of knowledge production. outsourcing and bottom-of-the-pyramid labour. and the creative service sector. Using a mixed-methods approach, we will document the unexpected challenges and the unanticipated innovative uses of this changing connectivity, and cut through through the hype by empirically evaluating benefits and impacts of new communication technologies in Africa. This project will thus contribute not only to academic and policy debates surrounding connectivity and Internet access, but will also provide a robust evidence base crucial in shaping future rounds of ICT related development projects in low-income countries."
BENELEX,Benefit-sharing for an equitable transition to the green economy - the role of law,"Can benefit-sharing address the equity deficit within the green economy? This project aims to investigate benefit-sharing as an under-theorised and little-implemented regulatory approach to the equity concerns (disregard for the special circumstances of developing countries and of indigenous peoples and local communities) in transitioning to the green economy. Although benefit-sharing is increasingly deployed in a variety of international environmental agreements and also in human rights and corporate accountability instruments, no comprehensive account exists of its conceptual and practical relevance to equitably address global environmental challenges. This project will be the first systematic evaluation of the conceptualisations and operationalisations of benefit-sharing as a tool for equitable change through the allocation among different stakeholders of economic and also socio-cultural and environmental advantages arising from natural resource use. The project will combine a comparative study of international law with empirical legal research, and include an inter-disciplinary study integrating political sociology in a legal enquiry on the role of “biocultural community protocols” that articulate and implement benefit-sharing at the intersection of international, transnational, national and indigenous communities’ customary law (global environmental law). The project aims to: 1. develop a comprehensive understanding of benefit-sharing in international law. 2. clarify whether and how benefit-sharing supports equity and the protection of human rights across key sectors of international environmental regulation (biodiversity, climate change, oceans, food and agriculture) that are seen as inter-related in the transition to the green economy. 3. understand the development of benefit-sharing in the context of global environmental law. and 4. clarify the role of transnational legal advisors (NGOs and bilateral cooperation partners) in the green economy."
UNIJURIS,Unilateralism and the protection of global interests: opportunities and limits of the exercise of state jurisdiction,"In the 20th century, states have increasingly sought to apply their laws to situations and persons beyond their borders. They typically did so to protect their own interests from harm spilling over their borders. Recently, however, states appear to be giving their laws ‘extraterritorial’ application to protect global interests, not only when prosecuting international criminals, but also by enacting emissions trading schemes to tackle global warming, by taking sanctions against foreign vessels involved in illegal fishing on the high seas docking in their port, and by fighting foreign corrupt practices with a view to furthering good governance in developing countries. Thus, it appears that a novel principle of jurisdiction is crystallizing that protects global interests through unilateral application of domestic (or regional) law. It is the aim of this research to study this development in-depth, and to examine in particular whether, and under what circumstances, international law countenances such an exercise of unilateral jurisdiction that is aimed at the protection of global interests. The project consists of two pillars. Pillar 1 studies three cases of states or regional organizations unilaterally applying their own laws to (partly) foreign situations considered as threatening global interests: (a) the exercise of unilateral jurisdiction aimed at mitigating climate change. (b) the exercise of port state jurisdiction aimed at protecting sustainable fishing and biological diversity on the high seas. (c) the exercise of unilateral jurisdiction to tackle foreign corruption practices. Pillar 2 is synthetic in nature, and assesses whether, and to what extent, general rules of jurisdiction and jurisdictional restraint concerning the protection of global interests are developing across various fields, including but not limited to the fields studied in Pillar 1."
LASI,"Law, science and interests in European policy-making","This project provides a detailed analysis of how European law structures the use of different types of expertise in European policy-making, and assesses whether and to what extent objectives such as ensuring scientific expertise, sound evidence and interest representation overlap or are in tension with each other. However, European law constitutes a particular social subsystem, a cognitive framework and a form of expertise. While law is expected to deliver the regulatory framework through which different types of expertise are incorporated into European policy-making, it is itself framed through a process in which different types of expertise play a role. This research project has therefore two objectives. Objective 1: Mapping and critically assessing the European legal framework that structures different types of expertise in European policy-making. Objective 2: Analysing how European law functions as a social subsystem and assessing how legal expertise functions in relation to other forms of expertise in European policy-making. While the project is inspired by legal theory, and in particular systems theory and reflexive law theory, it employs an interdisciplinary methodology ensuring a detailed empirical enquiry based on legal analysis, semi-structured elite interviews, process tracing of adopted policy measures, and network analysis. The project focuses on three policy areas that feature very different modes of European governance, namely nano-technology, employment, and competition policy."
ITEPE,Institutional Transformation in European Political Economy - A Socio-Legal Approach,"The objective is to develop a socio-legal theory explaining the institutional transformations from corporatism over neo-corporatism to governance and the role of law and legal instruments within the 3 types of institutions. The period of investigation covers the period between 1850 and today and is limited to the European setting. The core hypothesis is that corporatism, neo-corporatism and governance fulfil identical societal functions under altered structural conditions insofar as they simultaneously are oriented towards the internal stabilisation of economic processes and the establishment of compatibility with non-economic segments of society. The successful fulfilment of this dual function is furthermore conditioned upon a reliance on formalised legal frameworks. In concrete the project wishes to provide an alternative to the a-historical nature of contemporary governance research. counter the lack of a dynamic perspective within the ‘varieties of capitalism’ approach. offset the reductionist stance of political economy studies as reflected in the narrowing of economy and society relations to the binary relationship between economy and politics. develop a theoretical framework capable of connecting a wide range of so far disperse academic discourses such as governance research, political economy and socio-legal studies. provide a central contribution to a new inter-systemic theory of society. The project contains detailed case studies in relation to the development of institutional stabilisation within the European steel and pharmaceutical sectors."
LANDGRABRU,‘Land grabbing’ in Russia: Large-scale investors and post-Soviet rural communities,"The mid-2000s saw the emergence of large-scale land acquisitions. While processes of agricultural ‘land grabbing’ have received considerable global attention, particularly in Africa, the land grabbing issue in the countries of the post-Soviet region has gone largely unnoticed This research proposal aims to explore this omission in the ‘land grab’ debate by studying the case of Russia. The main research question is: To what extent and how has global land grabbing occurred in Russia, with what implications to local communities, and how have local communities resisted or modified these land deals (if at all)? The proposed research is pertinent by providing a case distinct from other regions, which is likely to raise new insights on global land grabbing. Several features make the case of Russia remarkably divergent. First, whereas in most parts of the world the current trends see an increase in population density and marginal and forest land being converted into cultivated land, Russia is witness to massive land abandonment and reforestation. Another particular feature is the low level presence of an autonomously organized civil society (which also manifests on the issue of land grabbing contestation). This research will be the first comprehensive study of land grabbing and related rural social movements in Russia and the post-Soviet area at large. Rural movements have been studied mainly in Latin-America, Africa and Asia. In contrast, research on rural movements in post/reform socialist contexts (such as China) is still in its infancy, and practically absent in Russia. The proposed research aims to establish a new field of ‘(post)-socialist land grabbing and rural social mobilisation’ studies. Moreover, it will contribute to more broad debates on civil society and protest in state dominated, post/reform-socialist countries, by studying these issues from the perspective of the (mostly ignored) rural areas."
Red Revolution,Red Revolution: The Emergence of Stem Cell Biotechnologies in India,"The biotechnological landscape in India can be conceptually demarcated as green and red. The post-independence, state supported, rise of ‘green, agricultural, biotechnologies’ - heralding the fabled ‘green revolution’ - is well documented. Less well understood is the recent rise of ‘red biotechnologies’ and moves to engineer a ‘red revolution’ of health care based on human tissues and biogenetic substance. The proposed project analyses the interplay between state, citizens/consumers and emerging markets in human stem cell technologies in India. These developments pose profound bioethical and political questions. The research examines the emerging research/therapy interface with a view to explicating the ‘high risk and high gain’ production of stem cell biotechnologies in India. The study will produce an in-depth multi-sited ethnographic mapping of the stem cell terrain in India. The main objective of this research is to critically understand the agential and structural processes authoring unprecedented new developments in stem cell research and therapeutics in India. These processes are captured under four interlaced research themes: (1) promissory health: state, citizens and stem cell biotechnologies (2) therapeutic mobility: global travel for stem cells (3) bioeconomy and biotechnology: public health or private wealth? (4) ethics of governance, governance of ethics. These important nodes are entry points into the world of science, clinic, economy, policy and polity. Together these sites will enable an ethnographic mapping of the disparate assemblages of actors, local and across the globe, which the red revolution is currently forging."
IDAR,The International Dimensions of Authoritarian Rule,"This project examines the international dimensions of transitions to and consolidation of authoritarian rule. The need for greater theoretical focus on the sources of authoritarian politics reflects the enduring power and influence of non-democratic regimes in an increasingly democratic world. However, while recent scholarship has sought to conceptualise and explain the enduring patterns of authoritarianism, the existing literature in this field has focused almost exclusively on domestic-level politics, and has marginalised international-level factors. Building on the expertise of the Principal Investigator in the international politics of regime change, this project will overturn existing understandings and will create a new agenda for future research by providing a dedicated and comparative analysis of international dimensions of authoritarian rule that rests on the systematic study of a wide range of quantitative and qualitative evidence by an integrated team of specialist researchers. The project will involve an innovative multi-method research design that combines advanced quantitative techniques (to assess the international influences on regime duration over time) with rigorous case study analyses (to identify the causal mechanisms linking international variables to domestic authoritarian politics). The four-year project will help establish a new scholarly community with a common intellectual focus, which will collectively pioneer a new agenda for research into the international politics of authoritarianism. The overall project team will be comprised of the PI, one full time-time post-doctoral research fellow, two full-time doctoral students, a part-time doctoral research assistant, and the partial involvement of Dr Jonathan Glub from the University of Reading. The project outputs will include a PI-authored monograph and a PI-edited collected volume, as well as a range of individual and collaborative research articles."
TICMP,Tolerance in Contemporary Muslim Practice: Political Theory Beyond the West,"Academic research has consistently studied conflict but there is very little engagement with actually existing tolerance mechanisms of tolerance and this project breaks new ground in studying tolerance by explicitly engaging with both empirical detail and theoretical constructions in the predominantly Muslim context of Pakistan. The project comprises of two strands of enquiry that come together to suggest a new way of approaching political theory from non-western contexts. By investigating the political thought of two key religious public intellectuals on the issue of tolerance at the same time as collecting oral histories and ethnographic interviews from population groups that live in extremely precarious contexts, such as recent refugees from Pakistan's tribal areas into three large cities, the project aims to help build a new field of study within European academia: comparative political theory."
UNDERINDIA,The Underbelly of the Indian Boom: Adivasis and Dalits,"In recent decades India has experienced exceptionally high economic growth rates, becoming one of the world’s fastest growing major economies. Yet, the redistribution of the fruits of economic growth – the trickle down effects of growth – have been negligible for vast swathes of India’s population, most of who live in the countryside. The demographics of the poor are starkly socially marked. Economists tell us that India’s dalit and adivasi communities, who account for almost 25% of the country’s population and were historically seen as ‘untouchable’ and ‘savage’, suffer from disproportionate levels of poverty, remaining worse off than other groups almost everywhere across the country. But econometric analysis is unable to tell us how and why this is the case. This project uses an innovative anthropological approach to understand the processes by which poverty is reproduced through agrarian relations and the shift from farm-based social and economic hierarchies towards new forms of power and exploitation off the farm which lead to the persistence of dalit and adivasi marginalisation across India. Informed by recent statistical research and policy shifts at the national and state levels, this project will craft a more critical and powerful alternative to poverty measurements by ethnographically exploring the relationship between political and economic transformations in rural-based dalit and adivasi lives, and the transformations taking place at the macro level. It thus establishes a new methodological field which structures ethnography in the framework of political economic theory and brings this combination to the centre of understandings of poverty. It will provide the first historically situated ethnographic studies which are comparative, not only in their regional distribution, but also in their underlying theoretical and methodological bases."
ReDefTie,Redefining tie strength – how social media (can) help us to get non-redundant useful information and emotional support,"Social media offer us effortless ways to stay in touch with large numbers of individuals. These individuals can be friends (strong ties), acquaintances (weak ties), or people we barely know (absent ties). Decades of social capital research have shown that strong ties are useful because they provide us with emotional support and weak ties are useful because they provide us with non-redundant useful information, but absent ties do not provide us with any benefits at all. Now, social media challenge these conclusions. Through social media, people connect to absent ties daily, so apparently there are benefits involved. My central question therefore is: To what extent do social media change how, and from whom, we seek and receive informational and emotional support? Social media technologies have changed the frequency and nature of our social connections. Smart phones allow a constant connection with our social network, sometimes even preventing us from socializing face-to-face. Twitter facilitates asymmetric relationships, such that even marginalized individuals can connect to important information sources. Facebook has set a norm where individuals who in the past we would merely have nodded to, are now embedded in our network of “friends“. It seems natural to assume that, if the way we maintain our social network changes, the way we extract social capital from that network also changes. To deepen our understanding of the effects of social media use on receiving informational and emotional support, I will employ several methods. By means of a large longitudinal study (subproject 1) in a representative sample, I aim to detect causal relationships between social media use at time t and informational and emotional benefits at time t+x. In addition, two subprojects will study in detail the cognitive and affective processes underlying informational (subproject 2) and emotional (subproject 3) benefits of social media use."
IGMs,International Grievance Mechanisms and International Law and Governance,"The paradigms and terms of global governance have raised considerable debates in social sciences, as this elusive notion reflects the complexification of the decision-making fora, actors and processes which address globalised issues. Primarily intended as the legal framework of inter-state relations, international law is deeply shaken up by global governance approaches. In particular, because of systemic regulation and justiciability gaps, it shows a relative inability to create the mechanisms necessary to encompass certain transnational activities which have an important impact while those directly affected often have no direct legal bond with the source-actor which could enable them to ask it directly to account. However, the international scene witnesses the emergence of international grievance mechanisms (IGMs) which escape from traditional legal patterns and might fill certain regulation and justiciability gaps. Though located in an international law context, they are not legal accountability mechanisms and are defined as non-judicial grievance mechanisms set up on a permanent basis by non-binding international instruments or international organizations, which aim at calling an entity –either public or not– to account for its actions when no responsibility/liability mechanism can be set in motion because of the nature of the actors involved, the lack of direct legal bond between them, and the fact the instruments these IGMs control ‘compliance’ with are non-binding. The proposal makes the hypothesis that the study of these mechanisms, which seem symptomatic of international regulation and justiciability gaps, can contribute to the understanding of the mutations international law is experiencing in the context of global governance and beyond, to enhance the knowledge of the challenges ahead in terms of global governance regulation."
DELPOWIO,Delegation of Power to International Organizations and Institutional Empowerment over Time,"In recent decades, there has been a steady increase in the number of international Organizations (IOs). At varying levels states have surrendered some authority to IOs, giving them different levels of institutional empowerment. While in the EU, IMF and World Bank there has been a steadily extension of their competences, in the GATT/WTO-Secretariat, NATO and WHO the degree of delegated authority has remained constant. How can we explain these different degrees of authority granted to IOs and their evolution over time? We argue that institutional empowerment is a function of temporal dynamics, the degree of cohesion among principals, and the institutional design of the delegation contract. On the theoretical side, the aim of the proposed interdisciplinary project is to produce theory-driven knowledge by developing a model of power delegation to IOs that integrates a temporal dimension into the principal-agent approach. This will be done by resorting to four different disciplines: political science, economics, law, and organizational sociology. On the empirical side, the main novelty of the project consists in adopting a comparative research design and a longitudinal perspective. We will analyse the institutional empowerment of six different IOs (EC/EU, GATT/WTO, IMF, WHO, UNESCO, and World Bank) over a period of 65 years (1950-2015). Given the aim and scope of this research, the project is to be regarded as theory-building and hypothesis-testing research. It will be based on extensive qualitative work conducted in the archives of these four IOs as well as on elite interviews with national and international officials. With this project we will gain new insights into the following fields: consequences of power delegation to IOs. temporal dimension of the interaction between states and IOs. preference formation of states. comparison of different types of IOs. This will allow us to answer the broader and more general question of the conditions under which IOs can operate as independent actors in world politics and to advance theoretical insights and empirical research in International Relations."
HUBBOR,"Human Rights Beyond Borders: The extraterritorial application of international human rights law - comparative legal, historical and theoretical approaches","This project will provide detailed, comprehensive, independent and authoritative explanation and critical appraisal of the extraterritorial application of human rights law, covering both civil and political rights and economic social and cultural rights, including the right to development. It will do this through analysis of both the law itself, and the cognate theoretical ideas and historical context. In its path-breaking cross-disciplinary orientation, the combined focus on law, theory—economic, social and political—and history will provide entirely novel ways of thinking about both the subject-matter and the cognate theoretical and historical ideas. Equally, the full-spectrum comparative treatment of human rights— not only civil and political rights but also economic, social and cultural rights—will provide new and innovative insights on the extraterritorial aspects of each area of law. Although the project will provide a more up-to-date treatment of the law, and a more sustained and even-handed treatment of the full range of human rights, than is offered in existing scholarship on the topic, more fundamentally the profoundly different methodological approach adopted will take ideas about the topic into entirely new terrain. The project is concerned with a radical innovation in analysis on the subject when compared to existing scholarship, in offering for the first time a cross-disciplinary analysis of the law through the application of theoretical and historical methodologies, and also an analysis of the broader theoretical and historical trends implicated in the relevant areas of law. The more ambitious methodological treatment in the project will break new ground in moving fully beyond exclusively or predominantly ‘black letter’ analyses of the law in existing scholarship, but in a manner that is then able to move back from the broader perspective to provide radically novel insights into that law drawn from it."
LexMercPub,Transnational Private-Public Arbitration as Global Regulatory Governance: Charting and Codifying the Lex Mercatoria Publica,"The proposed research will analyze the rising phenomenon of transnational arbitrations between private economic actors and public law bodies as a mechanism of global regulatory governance. It breaks with the prevailing view that arbitration involves no more than settling individual disputes and hypothesizes instead that arbitrators generate the rules governing public-private relations rather independently of specific domestic legal systems and their democratic processes, and thereby prospectively steer and restrict government conduct. The body of law thus crafted by arbitral tribunals is what the project designates as lex mercatoria publica, in allusion to the a-national law generated by arbitral tribunals in international private-private disputes. Unlike existing research, the proposed project will provide a comprehensive (historic, sociological, political, economic, and legal) perspective on the lex mercatoria publica and explore its legitimacy. It will, by empirically charting the modern and historic practice of private-public arbitration, describe and analyze the content of the lex mercatoria publica and develop, through comparative law research, normative criteria to assess the legitimacy of private-public arbitrations in democratic societies that are based on the rule of law. The research will result in a comprehensive online database and a codification of both the principles of private-public arbitration and of the lex mercatoria publica as developed and applied by arbitral tribunals. The project will enable arbitrators, judges, and other international and national decision-makers to render more predictable, more circumspect, overall better, and fairer decisions concerning private-public arbitration. This will provide solid foundations for enhancing transnational private-public arbitration as an institution of global regulatory governance in the interest of better and more efficient cooperation between states and private economic actors in the global economy."
LLECJ,Law and Language at the ECJ,"This project will examine the production of the multilingual jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ), aiming to elaborate a new understanding of the development of EU 'constitutional law'. The development of a rule of law within the EU is due in a large part to the judicial pronouncements of the ECJ. To date there has been no study which has taken account of the fact that the jurisprudence of the ECJ consists primarily of collegiate judgments drafted by jurists in a language that is generally not their mother tongue, undergoes many permutations of translation into and out of up to 23 different languages and is necessarily shaped by the way in which that Court functions as a multilingual, multicultural organisation, and the dynamics between actors within that Court (with the notable exception of the body of work built up by the PI in the current project proposal). Nor has there been any consideration of the important LINGUISTIC aspect of the role of the Advocate General in the formation of EU law. This project will build up on innovative research already carried out by the PI and will bring together theories and methodologies from research fields which traditionally pay little attention to each other (linguistic theories, anthropological research methods and law): examining the ECJ's jurisprudence, specifically through translation and taking account of the cultural compromises by which that Court functions, and considering the implications for the understanding and application of EU law."
HHPOLITICS,A Household Finance Theory of Political Attitudes and Political Behavior,"How do individuals insure themselves against economic shocks, as consumers and savers on their own, and as voters, through the political process? The recent financial and economic crisis has seen people lose their jobs and their housing equity, partly as a result of insufficient economic buffers in good times. What does this mean for social insurance? We need to understand the connection between household finances and political attitudes to social insurance and redistribution, both in good times and in bad. I argue that in order to understand the political economy of redistribution and social insruance, we need to allow for imperfect asset markets in the form of liquidity (or credit) constraints and for asset holdings, including housing equity. The goal of the project is to investigate theoretically and empirically on Danish data (i) how differences in liquidity constraints affect political attitudes and preferences. (ii) where such differences come from and what that means for understanding links between personal traits and personality, socio-economics and political attitudes and behaviour. (iii) how these insights can be used to understand political attitudes towards the new wave of neo-paternalistic policies (including so-called ‘nudging’) inspired by behavioural economic research. and (iv) whether differences in liquidity constraints can help us understand changes in political attitudes and preferences over the long-run. The central empirical part of the project is to link uniquely detailed individual level high quality data from Danish administrative registers - including current and historical data on all tax-declared income sources, bank deposits, assets and liabilities, as well as detailed demographics, educational and occupational data - to a running, large-scale panel survey of a large random sample of adult Danes, and to extend this survey both in time and in scope, specifically with questions on political attitudes and political preferences."
UNITRAN,Understanding Intergenerational Transmissions: A Cross-Disciplinary Approach,"This project combines the best sociology and economics has to offer to establish a new understanding of intergenerational transmissions. We know that socioeconomic outcomes are correlated across generations, but we have only little understanding of the mechanisms and intergenerational transmissions which generate these correlations. In this project, we propose to combine formal models of intergenerational transmissions in economics with substantive insights from sociology to develop new and improved models of intergenerational transmissions. Furthermore, we combine longitudinal data with state-of-the-art econometric methods to analyze intergenerational transmissions of cultural endowments and educational expectations, the role of the extended family in intergenerational transmissions, and finally the utility of educational decision making. The project has the potential to significantly improve our understanding of the causes and consequences of intergenerational transmissions and, in doing so, to contribute new knowledge to inform policies to promote social mobility."
Neo-Federalism,Dividing Powers among People(s): Towards a New Federal Theory for the 21st Century,"How should political power be divided within and among national peoples? Can the nineteenth-century theory of the sovereign and unitary State be applied to the social reality of the word of the twenty-first century? If not, what constitutional and philosophical theories can make sense of the empirical and normative world of our times? The rise of international organizations and, within Europe: the emergence of the European Union, have challenged the idea of the sovereign state ever since the end of the Second World War. And, in a seemingly paradoxical parallel, the myth of monolithic state power has equally come under attack from within states. Indeed: many modern states currently experience a political and constitutional devolution (Italy, Spain, United Kingdom). Can we identify these developments with federal theory? Federalism is a philosophical and a constitutional problem. The federal principle has made a long ‘journey through time in quest of a meaning’ (SR Davis). Modern federalism emerged with the rise of the European State system. And in the nineteenth century, the federal idea became reduced to the idea of the Federal State. In the light of this reductionism, international centralisation and regional decentralisation continue to be – largely – misunderstood by mainstream European legal scholarship. The proposed project would fill this gap by providing a comparative constitutional analysis of the federal principle. It will analyse the historical evolution of the principle from the eighteenth to the twenty century in the first part, and concentrate on three contemporary experiences of “dividing” or “sharing” sovereignty in the second. The three case studies of (neo)federalism in the 21st century correspond to three legal sphere: the international sphere (United Nations, World Trade Organisation), the supranational sphere (European Union, NAFTA), and the regional sphere (Spain, United Kingdom)."
COMBATTRAUMA,From warfare to welfare: a comparative study of how combat trauma is internalized and institutionalized,"This project is an anthropological study of combat trauma in three Western nations: Israel, the United States, and the Netherlands. Trauma means different things to different actors, and acquires a different value (both economic and social) in different therapeutic settings. Research will examine how clinical notions of combat trauma are established, adapted, resisted or internalized in different nations. It will result in a comparative framework for understanding how combat trauma is shaped by two major modern institutions: the military and psychiatry. Methodologically, it combines ethnographic fieldwork with veterans, research on clinical practices, and analysis of the policies and discourses that institutionalize combat trauma. Unusual within trauma studies, it aims to shed light on potentially conflicting values about violence and suffering in military and psychiatric instiutions, which may be less apparent to researchers trained within those institutions. By analyzing how veterans and clinicians perceive ethnicity, it will also contribute to understanding of the experiences of subordinate ethnic groups in military and psychiatric institutions. It is expected to identify key problems in the delivery of good care to veterans and have an impact on policy and healthcare. Theoretically, it will advance studies of biopolitics and medicalization. Existing theories tend to minimize how patients contest clinical models of illness. The moral significance of violence in combat trauma may, however, create particular kinds of resistance to clinical illness models – an issue that has not been previously addressed. This study will make a major contribution to understanding how war related suffering is internalized and institutionalized as clinical illness. It will also advance social science studies of psychiatry during a time when the field is undergoing a major and controversial move towards a biological approach to mental illness."
CSV,"Conflict, Strategies, and Violence: An Actor-based Approach to Violent and Non-Violent Interactions","Existing research has tended to equate conflict with violence, lumping all “non-conflict” situations together. This is unfortunate on theoretical and empirical grounds. Definitions of conflict highlight incompatibilities, which may motivate actors to resort to violence, but do not automatically generate violence and can be settled or managed in non-violent ways. Lumping together as “not violence” both cases without incompatibilities or agency and cases where actors pursue different strategies ultimately undermines our ability to understand conflict processes and test core arguments about conflict, strategies, and violence, and leaves us unable to assess whether the observed global decline in violence may reflect increasing use of alternative strategies, more state deterrence/accommodation, or fewer incompatibilities in the first place. This project will examine conflict in terms of incompatibilities between actors, where the specific structure of the incompatibilities and the strategies and interactions determine whether we see escalation to violence as well as alternative outcomes such as accommodation or regime change. It will extend my prior research on civil war and focus more clearly on actor motivations, alternative outcomes to conventional civil war, and take seriously non-violent strategies in conflict and protest. Whereas previous research has tended to study violent and non-violent conflict as separate phenomena, this project will focus on violent and non-violent actions as possible substitutes and compliment and explain variation across a range of alternative outcomes, as illustrated in the so-called Arab spring, where we see both non-violent protest and violent insurgencies, as well as state responses ranging from violent repression to accommodation. The project will also consider how transnational factors can influence the choice of strategies that actors make in conflicts."
GAPRR,Gendering activism in populist radical right parties. A comparative study of women’s and men’s participation in the Northern League (Italy) and the National Front (France),"Building on two pilot studies conducted in 2010, the proposed research will explore the gender dimensions of anti-immigration social movements in contemporary Europe. This will be done through a comparative analysis of activism in two populist radical right parties: an ethnographic and documentary study of activism in the social and cultural associations linked to the Northern League party (NL) in Italy and to the National Front party (NF) in France. During the applicant’s earlier research on the NL, it became clear that the themes of women’s rights and gender equality are increasingly mobilised in instrumental ways by this party, seeking to attract women’s votes. This corresponds to a recent radicalisation of the NL’s discourse, which in the past decade has increasingly targeted migrants coming from Muslim countries: in this discourse, immigration is associated with sexual violence and gender conservatism. The research will mobilise these earlier studies while expanding their focus through a comparative perspective. In examining current developments in the ideology and politics of the NL and the NF, and their attempt to modernise their public image, the proposed comparative research will contribute to ongoing theoretical debates about the articulation of racism and gender as well as about the role played by gender in collective action. The proposed research is ground-breaking in two ways. First, only a minority of ethnographic studies exist which focus on activism in radical right organisations, as sociologists have tended to focus on left-wing social movements. More specifically, very few studies have investigated the role played by women in radical right social movements. Second, the few existing qualitative studies of women’s activism in these organisations fail to compare systematically the practices women and men. As opposed to these existing studies, the proposed research will examine both women’s and men’s involvement in these organisations."
TEMS,The Effects of Marketization on Societies: The Case of Europe,"In the European Union and beyond, policymakers have come to use the market as a general-purpose policy tool. Dissatisfied with the existing institutions of capitalism, they have introduced price-based competition into new areas of life and ratcheted up competition where markets were already present. Although the recent financial crises have sparked protests and fuelled criticisms of the capitalist system, policymakers are responding with public sector and welfare state reforms that, in fact, constitute an intensification of market relations in society. I label the introduction and intensification of price-based competition ‘marketization’. The aim of the project is to establish a new strand of comparative institutional research into this phenomenon, by developing, grounding, and testing a general theory of marketization. The main proposition that the team will assess is that marketization leads to an increase in inequality, in terms of income, security, and participation. three separate mechanisms are proposed mediating this effect. TEMS opens new horizons in the understanding of economic governance, employment relations, and inequality. Data will be collected in four workplace contexts in four European countries – at least one of which will have implemented marketizing reforms as part of a financial bailout package – and a structured comparison will be conducted of the sixteen qualitative cases. The objectives are to (1) synthesize the theory and evidence on marketization and its social effects. (2) qualitatively document the phenomenon in four workplace contexts in four countries. (3) conduct analysis of the data drawing on the comparative and grounded-theory traditions, and (4) disseminate findings through a book, a reader, a series of articles, and online methods. The research team will include the PI and two lecturers (all spending 50% of their time on this project), a post-doc (on 100%), and a PhD student."
FoundLaw,Reinventing the Foundations of European Legal Culture 1934-1964,"It is often claimed in the rights and culture debate that certain rights are a reflection of a European culture and tradition and thus not universal. What this study demonstrates is that even in Europe the rights tradition is a conscious construction by a group of legal scholars reacting to contemporary events. This study is about a group of innovators who are forced to reinvent themselves and their science abroad after being exiled by Nazi Germany. This reinvention meant that they had to first rethink all that they had previously done and then to address a new audience in a new language, simultaneously trying to make sense of the catastrophe. In response, they created a theory a common European legal culture, founded on ideals of the rule of law. A reaction to the nationalistic totalitarian regimes, they sought to show a great tradition based on liberty and justice. What this study offers is a twist, in that the reinvention had a second, even more influential life after the war. What the anti-totalitarian narrative formed by the exiles offered to the academic community was an explanation and a new self-understanding of law and legal science as a bulwark against dictatorship, enabling them to respond to the challenge of socialism. Combining archival research, bibliometrical studies and social analysis, the project will study the creation of the rights theory through the intellectual histories of five key figures. Studying correspondence, lecture notes, and published materials on how the idea of a common European legal past was formulated, discussed and disseminated, the project contests the claims of current research that the rights tradition was an accepted historical fact. The starting point of the study, 1934, is the first response to the Nazi takeover and the expelling of civil servants of Jewish ancestry, while the end point, 1964, includes the reaction to the Berlin Wall and the consolidation of the hostilities between East and West in Europe."
INVEDUC,"Investing in Education in Europe: Attitudes, Politics and Policies","Comparative welfare state research has neglected the study of education for a long time. In particular, very little is known about citizens’ attitudes on education policies and how these attitudes are reflected in processes of policy reform. The core of the proposed project is to conduct an original survey in eight European countries to provide, for the first time, internationally comparative data on individual attitudes and policy preferences on education. Individual attitudes are conceptualized to vary along three dimensions: the level of investment in education relative to other social policies, the promotion of different kinds of education (academic versus vocational education) and the distribution of competencies across levels of governments (governance). Particular attention will be paid to policy feedback effects, i.e. how macro-level institutional contexts (welfare states) shape the dynamics of preference formation on the micro level. Thus, the ultimate goal is to be able to understand cross-national variation in policy attitudes. The second phase of the project will analyze the linkages between attitudes and policy-making, using the insights from the survey. In the form of case studies of recent education reforms, we will ascertain whether policy-makers cater to public opinion in general, particular electoral constituencies or organized interests. The project breaks new ground by expanding research on welfare state attitudes to the field of education policy and improving our general understanding of the linkages between citizens’ preferences and policy-making."
REFCOM,The Real Estate/Financial Complex,"Real estate and finance were at the roots of the global economic crisis that started in 2007. States and their many institutions have also been seen as complicit to the crisis. The connections between real estate (both residential and non-residential), finance and states still remain under-researched and under-theorized. Work in various political economy traditions has done a great deal of research into the connection between finance and states, but they have often ignored a crucial sector: real estate. There is also a tradition of work focusing on the interaction between real estate and states, usually concentrating on the involvement of municipalities in real estate projects. Finance is often ignored in this tradition. Moreover, this tradition has its roots in urban studies and is very micro focused, while the various political economy traditions are very macro focused. In other words, we not only need a stronger connection between finance and real estate, we also need a stronger connection between different scales: local/urban, national and global. I here propose a new metaphor that can help us to centre attention on the connection between real estate, finance and states: the real estate/financial complex, akin the military/industrial complex. Both complexes should be seen as triangles since states are also part of the equation. A Postdoc will do internationally comparative research on both the quantitative and qualitative shifts towards real estate, finance and their interaction. Three PhD students will focus on two countries each, each complementing two national mappings of the complex with two local/urban case studies. The PI will focus on the qualitative shift towards real estate, finance and the role of the state in this. the global dimensions of the complex. and the conceptualization of the complex in relation to the structural changes in state-society-market relations."
CitizenSense,Citizen Sensing and Environmental Practice: Assessing Participatory Engagements with Environments through Sensor Technologies,"This project will investigate, through three case studies, the relationship between technologies and practices of environmental sensing and citizen engagement. Wireless sensors, which are an increasing part of digital communication infrastructures, are commonly deployed for environmental monitoring within scientific study. Practices of monitoring and sensing environments have migrated to a number of everyday participatory applications, where users of smart phones and networked devices are able to engage with similar modes of environmental observation and data collection. Such “citizen sensing” projects intend to democratize the collection and use of environmental sensor data in order to facilitate expanded citizen engagement in environmental issues. But how effective are these practices of citizen sensing in not just providing “crowd-sourced” data sets, but also in giving rise to new modes of environmental awareness and practice? Through intensive fieldwork, study and use of sensing applications, the case studies will set out to contextualize, question and expand upon the understandings and possibilities of democratized environmental action through citizen sensing practices. The first case study, “Wild Sensing,” will focus on the use of sensors to map and track flora and fauna activity and habitats. The second case study, “Pollution Sensing,” will concentrate on the increasing use of sensors to detect environmental disturbance, including air and water pollution. The third case study will investigate “Urban Sensing,” and will focus on urban sustainability or “smart city” projects that implement sensor technologies to realize more efficient or environmentally sound urban processes."
GoJ,THE GENDER OF JUSTICE: THE PROSECUTION OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN ARMED CONFLICT,"The international community now recognises the impact of ‘gender-based harms’ of conflict, the armed violence that targets or disproportionately affects women. It also acknowledges the obligation to prosecute these crimes. However, many claim that international justice continues to fail women victims of war. So are we witnessing a new age of accountability for these crimes against women? Or does international criminal justice reproduce existing gender inequalities? Some fifteen years after the establishment of the first international criminal tribunal, these questions remain unanswered. The proposed research takes up these fundamental problems of gender and justice, and develops an innovative research ‘gender justice’ framework. This framework engages with the thoroughly social nature of gender and justice. It examines how social actions and norms construct categories of the person, the harmful, and the just by building a social theory of ‘gender justice’. This theory investigates the nature of gender harms, identifies how sexual differentiation shapes law, and provides a normative model of gender justice. It is built upon a unique socio-legal case study of the international and national prosecution of sexual violence in the Yugoslavian conflict. Sexual violence in armed conflict is the most pervasive and visible of criminalised gender-based harms. It is also the area in which international law claims to have made its most significant advances. This case study provides a systematic and rigorous means of building models of highly complex social processes, and of developing explanatory and normative theories of ‘gender justice’. The project proposes a new framework that takes ‘gender justice’ as an object of research. It creates a new field of inquiry, with specific research problems, new conceptual and methodological frameworks, and identifiable normative criteria. Ultimately, the project aims to change our ideas of ‘gender justice’ itself."
MISTS,Market-Based Initiatives as Solutions to Techno-Scientific Problems,"MISTS engages with market based initiatives employed as potential solutions to techno-scientific problems. MISTS will draw together two strands of STS research: the turn to research on markets and STS literature on science problems (and solutions). These two areas will be drawn on in exploring four sub-projects which feature market based initiatives as solutions to problems: an attempt to build a market for privacy. an initiative to incentivise vaccine research. a scheme through which trading of evidence in electronic waste could take place. and a national system to render STS research competitive. Objectives: To enhance our understanding of the ways in which market based initiatives are increasingly being harnessed to address techno-scientific problems To understand the genesis, development, experience and consequence of utilising markets as solutions to problems To analyse in-depth the recursive nature of problem-solution relationships To draw together hitherto often separate strands of STS research To develop and consolidate a research programme focused on techno-scientific markets, problems and solutions Market based initiatives are pervasive as apparent solutions to techno-scientific problems. From the management of waste, to attempts to invigorate competition in (social) scientific research, markets are heralded as a means to redistribute economic and moral value, reorient priorities and stimulate action. However, market based initiatives are also frequently critiqued for their apparent failure, for shaping the actions of those subject to them and for a broad variety of other unexpected and unintended consequences. The four sub-projects, addressing key areas of contemporary concern – privacy, health, environment and the future of academia – will form a research programme which will develop insights for the STS research community, for those involved in researching markets and for those interested in techno-scientific problems and solutions."
SUBJECTPENAL,"Subjectivity, Identity and Penal Power: Incarceration in a Global Age","This project has two primary, interrelated, goals: to develop new methodological and intellectual tools in understanding the global and transnational reach of penal power and to revitalize the literature on subjectivity and identity in criminology. It is guided by three research questions that it will investigate in four distinct yet inter-related areas: penal theory, the contemporary prison, the immigration detention centre and human rights law. The research questions are: 1) What is the relationship between penal power and national identity? 2) How is that relationship gendered? 3) What do the experiences and views of those subject to penal power tell us about (the limits and nature of) state power in a global age? Taking the prison, the immigration detention centre and the immigration and asylum tribunal as sites where local/national and global power intersect, this project will examine theoretically and empirically the ways in which people experience and negotiate such places, paying particular attention to how matters of identity, especially race, gender, national identification and their intersections, shape the experience, meaning and effects of incarceration. By placing race, gender, and citizenship at the centre of analysis of penal power, this project seeks not only to hold up to scrutiny such core explanatory concepts as legitimacy, culture and power, but also to develop an empirically grounded theoretical framework that will overcome the boundaries between macro and micro-level sociological approaches to incarceration. In so doing the research will significantly reorient how penal power is investigated and understood."
PharmaSecurity,Pharmaceuticals and Security: The Role of Public-Private Collaborations in Strengthening Global Health Security,"Governments in Europe (and beyond) have begun to express grave concern about a number of acute, transnational health threats endangering their citizens and economies. Whether it is the spectre of a future pandemic, the threat of a bioterrorist attack, or the continuing burden of infectious diseases in many developing countries - strengthening the protection against transnational public health threats is increasingly viewed as an urgent matter of international politics. Ongoing efforts by the European Union to develop its own health security strategy will require the formation of effective and sustainable partnerships with numerous stakeholders, including the scientific, medical, and public health communities, as well as private industry – especially in the form of pharmaceutical companies. The latter are particularly crucial actors because of the prominent role that pharmaceutical therapies like vaccines, antivirals, antibiotics, etc. play in strengthening health security. Cooperation with the pharmaceutical industry is therefore necessary to ensure that the required drugs are available in sufficient quantities, in the places where they are needed, and at the right time. Yet very little – if anything – is actually known about the role of pharmaceutical companies in the formulation and implementation of health security policy. This crucial area not only remains under-researcher. it is, in fact, almost entirely un-researched. The core research challenge this project takes up, therefore, is to conduct the first systematic study of the role of pharmaceutical businesses in health security. The aim of the project is both to improve our understanding of the role that pharmaceutical companies play in shaping contemporary health security policy, and to explore how the emerging (but also politically sensitive) partnerships with pharmaceutical companies can be responsibly managed in the years ahead."
DISCONEX,The Discursive Construction of Academic Excellence. Classifying SSH Researchers Through Text-Processing Practices,"DISCONEX investigates two types of text-processing practices by means of which academic researchers are classified in different national and disciplinary fields of the social sciences and humanities (SSH). The research project will produce theoretically informed and empirically grounded insights into the social organization of SSH research. Drawing from constructivist social theory and qualitative methods in discourse analysis and pragmatics, the research team investigates the discursive construction of excellence as a practical accomplishment of readers cooperating with texts. In a first step, we collect CVs from confirmed SSH researchers from France, Germany, the UK and the U.S.. Then we carry out reader interviews to investigate how membership is negotiated in specialized knowledge communities of the SSH. In a second step, we investigate non-academic practices of processing large text collections in order to account for how academic producers are ranked by evaluation professionals and calculative technologies. Finally, by comparing representations of excellence produced by academic and non-academic actors, DISCONEX will show how knowledge producers and ranking experts account for the representations of other types of readers respectively. In the light of the complex interpretive problems involved in the reading and writing of academic texts, we will produce reflexive knowledge on how SSH researchers are classified in the light of new modes of academic knowledge production. Given the important role that written texts play in SSH discourse, the exchange between the sociology of science and discourse analysis can help establish a new field: the social sciences and humanities studies (SSHS)."

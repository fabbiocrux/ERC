This paper aims to describe how alternative economic education including concepts of the circular economy (CE), cradle to cradle (C2C) and zero waste can be addressed by teacher education. The author asks to what extent such alternative concepts contribute to sustainability education and transitions and empower students and future teachers, through fieldtrips. Design/methodology/approach: Fieldtrips to three extracurricular learning places in Graz (Austria) – a plastic waste disposal facility, an upcycling design atelier and a supermarket without packaging – were organized as part of a university seminar on economy and sustainability. Based on student essays reflecting the fieldtrips, this praxeological paper provides insights on how students perceive awareness-raising and innovative responses to mass consumption, recycling/upcycling and waste prevention issues. Findings: Including altermatic economic frameworks, such as CE/C2C and zero waste, into teacher education contributes to reflections on the economic growth paradigm and promotes more sustainable futures. In various statements, students highlighted social-ecological change and awareness-raising. They rather focussed on recycling, upcycling and (plastic) packaging than on the problematic eco-efficiency of downcycling. Originality/value: Alternative economic concepts can be addressed and critically reflected in sustainability education, even if rarely taught. Although the extracurricular learning places described offer partial solution from the perspective of degrowth, they can serve as an eye-opener and promote alternative economic education, where students can share experiences, knowledge and creative ideas to engage in sustainability transitions. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Circular economy/cradle to cradle; Fieldtrips; Recycling/upcycling; Sustainability education; Teacher education; Zero waste",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125601026

The paper highlights that green recovery and the green transition have different connotations in different parts of the world, leading to a huge divergence in their delineations across the Global North and South. The paper further argues that models of degrowth, which emphasize contraction of economic activities for the cause of nature, cannot be applied in large parts of the developing world. The challenge for a developing nation like India is to understand how and where it can position itself in this gamut of developmental paradigms that range between growth-fetishism and green recovery. The paper proposes that Indian green recovery must be based on the Sustainable Development Goals, hinging on two key elements: a) simultaneous augmentation of health-and education-induced human and physical capital without compromising the sustainability of natural capital; and b) reduced wealth, income, and social inequalities, thereby serving the cause of distributive justice. © Ghosh 2022.","Degrowth; Global North; Global South; Green Recovery; Growth-Fetishism; Human Capital; India; Natural Capital; Sustainable Development Goals",,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135166387

In this study, we propose a new paradigm of polarization isolation utilizing intrinsic electronic properties, realizing in situ isolation during device epitaxy without the need of post-growth processing. Specifically, adjacent III- and N-polar AlGaN/GaN heterojunctions were grown simultaneously on the patterned AlN nucleation layer on c-plane sapphire substrates. The two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) was formed at III-polar regions but completely depleted in N-polar regions, thereby isolating the 2DEG channels with a large 3.5 eV barrier. Structures of polarization-isolated high electron mobility transistors (PI-HEMTs) exhibit significantly reduced isolation leakage currents by up to nearly two orders of magnitude at 50 V voltage bias compared to the state-of-the-art results. Aside from that, a high isolation breakdown voltage of 2628 V is demonstrated for the PI-HEMT structure with 3 μm isolation spacing, which is two-times higher than a conventional mesa-isolation HEMT. Moreover, the PI-HEMT device shows a low off-state leakage current of 2 × 10-8 mA/mm with a high Ion/Ioff ratio of 109 and a nearly ideal subthreshold slope of 61 mV/dec. This work demonstrates that polarization isolation is a promising alternative toward the plasma-damage-free isolation for GaN electronics. © 2022 Author(s).",,"Aluminum gallium nitride; Aluminum nitride; Electronic properties; Etching; Gallium nitride; Heterojunctions; High electron mobility transistors; III-V semiconductors; Leakage currents; Sapphire; Two dimensional electron gas; Damage-free; Device geometries; GaN HEMTs; High electron-mobility transistors; Ions implantation; MESA etching; N-polar; Plasma damage; Polar Regions; Polarization-modulation; Polarization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134192779

Environmental psychology has traditionally focused on the underlying barriers towards more pro-environmental behaviours. Emotions—like fear or anger—may act as such barriers especially in case of radical change (e.g., degrowth). While minority influence has been extensively applied to understand societal change, it has rarely been applied to understand the emotional responses that may hinder counter-normative pro-environmental messages. However, past literature on emotions shows that, in challenging situations—the likes of radical minority conflict—people will tend to use their emotional reaction to maintain societal status quo. Two studies investigated how participants emotionally react towards a counter-normative pro-environmental minority message (advocating degrowth). A qualitative (thematic analyses) and a quantitative (emotional self-report paradigm) studies showed that participants report emotions that allow them to realign themselves with the cultural backdrop of the social dominant paradigm (growth), thus resisting change. Specifically, although all participants tend to demonstrate higher proportions of control-oriented emotions, men do so more. These effects, as well as questions of cultural and ideological dominance, are discussed considering barriers towards pro-environmentalism.

Yet, the success of countries is measured by indicators known to be limited because they target a socially attractive but environmentally unsustainable model of society. A myriad of indicators have been proposed to address this lack of relevant measurements that assess the real social achievements of countries. At the same time, the impacts of human societies on life and climate have become increasingly well monitored and have shown the ecological deadlock of the dominant development model. Although social and environmental thresholds have been highlighted, combined indices that allow countries to track their trajectories toward greater social justice without exceeding biophysical thresholds are still lacking. A combined socio-environmental index (SEI) is constructed here to fill this gap. The relationship between SEI and gross domestic product (GDP), population density and sustainable development index (SDI) is then analyzed. This allows for a re-examination of the Easterlin paradox from a social and environmental perspective. In addition, considering population density allows to test the influence of population on the country’s sustainability success. It is shown that combining social and environmental thresholds into a combined index is not only feasible but provides a useful complementary tool to detailed and specific social or environmental indicators. SEI highlights and quantifies the limits, already exceeded in many countries, beyond which economic development is clearly related to a decline in social achievements and a crossing of biophysical thresholds. Unlike GDP, population density and population growth were not found as being related to the current unsustainable development model. Therefore, the results call for a degrowth in the environmental impact of high-income countries, which may result in social improvements and yield room of maneuver for the development of social foundations in other countries. All of these transformations require new narratives, goals, and measurement tools that can be partly provided by SEI. © 2022 by the author(s).","degrowth; Easterlin paradox; planetary boundaries; socio-environmental index; strong sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133215555

We argue that a deeper understanding of democracy is needed to foster just transitions. First, we present a multi-dimensional understanding of justice in transitions and relate it to scholarship on democratizing transitions. Then, we argue that three paradigm shifts are required to overcome current unsustainable dynamics: (1) from expert toward pluralist understandings of knowledge; (2) from economic materialism toward post-growth strategies; and (3) from anthropocentrism toward reconnecting human-nature relationships. We explicate what these paradigm shifts entail for democratizing transitions from distributive, procedural, recognition and restorative justice perspectives. Finally, we highlight six challenges to institutionalizing deep democratic governance. These entail balancing tensions between: multiple justice dimensions, democracy and urgency, top-down and bottom-up directionalities, local and global scales, realism and idealism, and roles of incumbent scientific systems.

Our results confirm that reducing and redistributing income alone, within current development paradigms, leads to limited greenhouse gas (GHG) emission mitigation from agriculture and land-use change, as the nutrition transition towards unsustainable diets already occurs at relatively low income levels. Instead, we show that a structural, qualitative food system transformation can achieve a steady-state food system economy that is net GHG-neutral by 2100 while improving nutritional outcomes. This sustainable transformation reduces material throughput via a convergence towards a needs-based food system, is enabled by a more equitable income distribution and includes efficient resource allocation through the pricing of GHG emissions as a complementary strategy.

The author designs a simple stock–flow consistent macroeconomic model and simulates an acceleration of obsolescence in different budget and fiscal policy scenarios. His results show that, despite the increase in revenues generated by extra constrained expenditures and the associated multiplicative effects, the economic consequences of fast obsolescence remain negative. As effective disposable income declines for workers and either decreases less or increases for capitalists, income and wealth inequalities are exacerbated. Hence an acceleration of obsolescence has detrimental effects both on distributive and on environmental grounds. Conversely, in line with the degrowth paradigm, the author shows how slowing down obsolescence may be sensible both socioeconomically and environmentally.

Despite their importance as life supporting ecosystems, forests, oceans, and wetlands are being destroyed at an accelerating rate. The conservation and restoration of mangroves, for example, are also vital for the planet to face catastrophic global warming. Based on a non-systematic literature review, we address how true mangrove conservation is incompatible with so-called “sustainable development”. We turn to the urgent changes needed to avoid environmental and societal collapse, promoted by the Western economic development paradigm, and address why the sustainable development approach has failed to stop environmental degradation and protect resources for next generations. Proposed solutions involve the rejection of the capital-oriented, nature-predatory systems, degrowth, a deep transformation of our energy matrix, and a shift in our nutrition to lower levels of the food chain. These are based on a profound sense of responsibility over the planet, respecting all life forms, ecosystem dynamics, and life sustaining properties of the biosphere. © 2022 by the authors.

It argues that the framework of sustainable development accommodates the Global North's inaction in assuaging environmental degradation and alleviating global inequality by remaining embedded in a capitalist, growth-oriented political economy. Degrowth would provide a strategy to move past such an impasse by encouraging actors to grapple with the role growth plays in the rationale behind I.Econ.L. Degrowth advocates a planned economic contraction to reconcile human's relationship with the environment. This project serves as the first effort to link ideas of degrowth with I.Econ.L. and seeks to identify some of the areas in I.Econ.

Members eschewed many forms of technology, lived collectively, harbored stray animals, and strove toward an entirely raw food diet in a communal lifestyle that many today would label 'simple living' or 'primivitist.' They rejected fashion and cosmetics, demonstrated for animal liberation as well as against police brutality, militarism, prisons, and pollution of land, water, and air. Notably, John Africa and MOVE emphasized the need to maintain sobriety and break with personal addictions in order to achieve personal and societal balance. Yet, rather than a set of 'single issues' strung together, John Africa formulated an all-encompassing paradigm. This article presents John Africa's paradigm as well as his grassroots decolonial semiotics that critically deconstructed, qualified, repurposed, and reframed conventional English language terms toward emancipatory and radically egalitarian ends. This paradigm, based on 'Mother Nature' and oneness, aligned with (without overtly borrowing from) many Indigenous and Aboriginal paradigms that similarly locate human life as interwoven with habitats and nonhuman animals. Whether or not one agrees with his ideas or approach, John Africa and the organization he co-founded seem to clearly qualify as early pioneers of degrowth. This article brings their hitherto unrecognized contributions into conversation with degrowth literature both to fill out the historical record and provide potentially useful insights for degrowth researchers and organizers alike. © 2022.

The first is the oligopolistic market structure of container shipping, the downsides of which became evident during the COVID-19 pandemic. The second challenge is climate change, both the need to reduce emissions to zero by 2050 and to adapt to effects that are already locked in. The paper reviews the academic and policy literature and unveils a link between these market and environmental challenges which result from a focus on efficiency without considering negative effects such as diseconomies of scale and induced traffic, leading to a continued rise in total industry carbon emissions. The review likewise identifies links in how policy-makers react to the two challenges. Regulators could remove anti-trust exemptions from carriers, and policy-makers are being pushed to provide strict decarbonisation targets with a coherent timeline for ending the use of fossil fuels. Recent thinking on ecological economics, degrowth and steady-state economics is introduced as the paradigm shift that could link these two policy evolutions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Climate change; COVID-19; Decarbonisation; Degrowth; Governance; Maritime transport; Regulation; Seaports; Shipping",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133924894

Our cluster analysis unveils three cognitive types. Our findings show that whereas some future managers exhibit a ‘business case’ cognitive frame, prioritizing economic growth over the environment, the other two clusters of participants show signs of cognitive dissonance with some of the tenets of the current growth paradigm while still not neatly fitting the definition of a paradoxical cognitive frame. In particular, individuals within the latter two groups do not visualize links among economic, social, and environmental dimensions that make up sustainable development. Following calls to enhance our understanding of sustainability micro-foundations, our study offers a more nuanced picture of the cognitive plurality beyond dichotomous characterizations of managerial cognitive frames as either business case or paradoxical. Moreover, results elucidate the cultural mediation that operates in the reproduction of business stances vis-à-vis nature, opening up possibilities for management education programs to engage with cognitive plurality to effect paradigmatic change. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Economic growth; Latin America; Managerial cognition; Post-growth; Sustainability",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132843442

However, MSIs can be critiqued as an incremental rather than transformative approach to environmental sustainability, firmly embedded within a green-growth paradigm. This article examines the limits and opportunities of MSIs in aiding a systemic transformation for sustainability within the fashion system. By analysing fashion-specific MSIs at two time points, 2017 and 2021, we identify that while MSI membership is growing and a degree of consolidation and harmonisation is occurring, environmental gains are offset by unrelenting growth in production. Drawing upon principles of degrowth, we propose that a scenario in which an MSI construct could have transformative power is one in which overproduction is explicitly addressed. © The Author(s) 2022","environmental impact; fashion; Multi-stakeholder initiatives; overproduction; sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132419900

Three fundamental premises underly an investigation of these issues. Firstly, territorial management underpins global environmental justice through the implementation of conservation policies; Secondly, degrowth narratives must operate in the urban context; and thirdly, there is a need for a paradigm shift at an economic, social and nature-relational level. This article presents two research approaches. Firstly, it sets out a theoretical framework in the field of ‘urban degrowth’, collecting arguments from political ecology, urban planning, deep ecology and degrowth thinking; and secondly, it proposes a preliminary line of investigation towards the process of urban de-occupation and re-naturalization through a bibliographic analysis of urban-ecological variables fostering natural recovery. The aim of the study is to stir up discussion about urban degrowth, as an essential mechanism to counter increasing land consumption, and global habitat and biodiversity loss.

However, mainstream CE discourses have been critiqued for being ecomodernist and for focusing too much on managerial issues, at the expense of justice and social aspects, and thereby risking not leading to the systemic changes so direly needed. Given this backdrop, as well as cities key role in responding to sustainability challenges, this article adopts a posthumanist intersectionality-perspective to explore the transformative potential of a municipal policy in which CE has been adopted as a key strategy for achieving change. A critical policy analysis of the City of Gothenburg’s new Environment and Climate Programme reveals that, apart from a focus on efficiency, the Programme also includes a politics of sufficiency and decreased consumption, thus potentially taking a first step within Swedish public sector towards an outspoken post-growth paradigm. The analysis, moreover, provides insights into what notions of citizens (or Gothenburgians), justice, responsibility, and nature–human relations the Programme is underpinned by.

Based on the degrowth literature and Illich’s work, we derive principles and criteria for the mobility of a degrowth society that include institutional, energy and material use, infrastructure, local environmental impacts, social impacts and justice, proximity and speed, and autonomy. To ground our analysis in real-world conditions, we consider the practical perspective of mobility and add another set of criteria: comfort and safety, travel time, monetary cost, and health. We then compare urban mobility options, including recently developed hybrid mobility and sharing schemes. Our results show that, although private means have an advantage in terms of personal practicality, they are not desirable from a degrowth perspective, due to their high social and environmental costs and as constituting a source of urban injustice. Public, hybrid, and self-propelled mobility options would become more practical if such injustices were recognised, and if effective public policies challenged the radical monopoly of cars. Further, hybrid options and sharing/pooling schemes have the potential to reduce the use of private means for metropolitan mobility. The adoption of this degrowth framework can enrich debates on sustainable urban mobility and moves beyond the common proposition of promoting public transport as the solution. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","active mobility; Degrowth; Ivan Illich; multi-criteria analysis; urban traffic","metropolitan area; mobility; multicriteria analysis; public transport; road traffic; urban transport",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123470462

Degrowth literature has not yet fully recognised the potentiality of urban/urban regional spatial development and planning in facilitating and driving the degrowth transformation for local and regional sustainability and justice. The possibility of urban planning to facilitate a downscaling of the economy, save the environment and secure distributive justice is predicated on the causal relationships between space and societal conditions. Therefore, planning has the potentiality of providing spatial instruments in a degrowth transformation. On the other hand, the mainstream growth-oriented planning paradigm is facing internal and external imperatives for transformation. Degrowth values and principles provide inspiration for urban planning to rethink its role and function in urban and societal development, specifically on three fronts: ideology, substantive values and utopianism.

Transforming the current dominant economic discourse will be a great challenge of our time and one that can foster a transformation to a more sustainable state. Little research exists concerning perceptions of growth by individuals in rural areas. In this empirical study, we analysed 33 interviews from two rural communities in Northwest Germany through qualitative content analysis. Our results highlight four archetypical perceptions of economic growth: (1) growth as inherently positive, (2) growth as being self-evident and without alternatives, (3) growth as a systemic constraint, and (4) growth as critical and with negative consequences. Differing perceptions about five key themes within broader societal discourses shape the four archetypical perceptions. All four archetypes are characterized by a common perception of systemic constraints, a lack of concrete alternatives to the current economic system and a lack of individual and societal agency, showing a system that is locked into its current trajectory. The understanding of the consequences of growth, stemming from the knowledge of rural inhabitants, can lay the groundwork for future research on discourses of growth. We envision a strengthening of tangible alternatives to the dominant economic growth paradigm within and with the local communities as necessary for a sustainability transformation. © 2021, The Author(s).","Agricultural intensification; Degrowth; Landscape; Leverage points; Social imaginaries; Social-ecological systems; Sustainability science",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116468659

The article has two aims. First, it examines how the Greek crisis has been discussed within the post-growth debate and focuses on three views: Greece as a post-growth anti-paradigm, Greece as an opportunity for democratic post-growth and austerity in Greece as a path for anti-Keynesian degrowth. Second, the article examines how ideas and projects with a post-growth orientation have influenced specific social initiatives born out of the crisis period in Greece. Some of these initiatives are reviewed (self-organized social and economic collectives, grassroots initiatives for solidarity, solidarity economy actions, etc.). As further discussed in the article, these initiatives were part of a broader ‘countermovement’ (Polanyi), and they faded together with other forms of labour and social protest, in accordance with events at the central political scene, and especially SYRIZA’s adoption of Memoranda politics. It is observed that in the post-Memoranda era in Greece, although past strategies of social reproduction are either unavailable (the pre-crisis finance-led growth model) or no longer equally effective (the familistic social model) and fiscal discipline remains, the search for other alternatives, including social initiatives with a post-growth orientation, did not actually extend as was expected, due to some new growth opportunities, e.g. in the field of tourism. It is finally concluded that, although they constituted an important part of the Greek countermovement, born as responses to the crisis, these social initiatives did not manage to consolidate more permanent structures of social action that could successfully challenge the neoliberal agenda. © The Author(s) 2021.","austerity; debt crisis; Eurozone; Greece; post-democracy; post-growth",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100051387

Especially in sociology this is said to require a paradigm shift in analysis and theory formation. This article argues that such a conclusion is premature. Owing to a scholastic fallacy – the uncritical transposition of the concept from the natural to the social sciences – Anthropocene lacks analytic clarity and explanatory power evidenced by: a normative overreach that erroneously imagines an idealised world citizenry with collective action capacities; an obfuscation of the unequal distribution of ecological pathologies caused by capitalism; a normative indeterminacy concerning modes of redress; and an abstract ecological universalism offered as moral panacea. The article suggests that sociology needs to address the Anthropocene’s heterogeneity marked by contradictory regional interests and inequalities that neither appeals to social justice or ‘one humanity’ nor an escape into a dissolution of ontological differences between actors and artefacts can redeem. To that end, sociologists are asked to undertake a critical reconstruction of the concept. © The Author(s) 2021.","Anthropocene; environment; globalisation; post-growth; sociological theory",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101506062

Urban development is the motor of economic growth; cities are therefore prime sites of intervention for degrowth activists. Nevertheless, the planning processes that drive urban development have yet to be questioned from a degrowth perspective. To clear a path for a degrowth urban agenda, this paper rethinks the institutions governing urban development in growth-dependent contemporary economies. It starts by problematizing the regional territorialization of economic competition, ideology of land scarcity, and institution of zoned property rights, which together make urban development an engine of growth. It then outlines three transitions toward urban degrowth, arguing for a regional imaginary of polycentric autonomism, a paradigm of finity in development, and care for habitability as principle of spatial organization. © The Author(s) 2020.","city-regional economies; city-regional planning; Degrowth; property rights; urban development","property rights; urban development; urban economy; urban growth; urban planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099312860

Most archaeologists had no alternative but to adapt to it through concessions to the free-market economy and to the so-called mitigations taking place within development. However, it is now apparent that the ongoing global socio-ecological disaster we are facing cannot be reversed with compromises but rather with a radical engagement against the injunctions of competition and growth. I suggest that we must anticipate the necessary transformations of archaeology in the coming decades, before archaeology becomes a technical avatar of the neo-liberal dogma, or before its complete annihilation for being deemed 'superfluous' (Wurst 2019, 171) by the capitalist regime.

It is suggested that the transition from one to the other – understood as the first collective step towards degrowth – requires a transformation in the way we, in western capitalist society, define ourselves in relation to nature. This identity transformation corresponds with the reconnection between humans and nature that ecopsychology has been calling for since its emergence in the 1970s. However, according to recent empirical studies in existential psychology, such a transformation contains po-tentially disquieting aspects, since it implies recognising and accepting the idea of our own mortality. Staging a dialogue between ecopsychology and crit-ical degrowth theories, this article argues that the necessary transition towards degrowth requires new ways of dealing with these existential fears – namely, confronting them in a ‘reflexive’ rather than ‘defensive’ way – so as to develop relationships with nature that respect the limits of the biosphere. © 2020 The White Horse Press. $REM.","Dominant Social Paradigm; Ecological identity; Ecopsychology; Existential psychology; New Ecological Paradigm","biosphere; mortality; paradigm shift; socioeconomic conditions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105776014

The critique of this view has increased recently. In this context post-growth concepts, such as sustainable degrowth, emerged as an alternative paradigm focusing on ensuring human wellbeing within planetary boundaries. Since business activity is a key driving force behind economic growth, the role of corporate organizations in a transition towards a post-growth society is a particularly challenging question. It is still unclear, for instance, what business models for organizations approaching degrowth could look like. Therefore, our study aims to contribute to understanding guiding principles for organizations approaching degrowth. In this exploratory work, we use a two-step approach: First, based on a systematic literature review, we derive principles for a conceptual framework composed of business-relevant claims in the degrowth discourse in order to assemble and synergize fragmented findings. The resulting conceptual framework serves to describe and assess organizations with respect to their approximation to degrowth. Second, we apply the framework to four organizations certified as B Corps based on qualitative content analysis of interviews with corporate representatives and additional company data. Overall, our findings show that B Corps rather successfully implement numerous degrowth-approaching principles in their organization within our current economic system, while none of the organizations is seen as fully degrowth-conform. With our analysis we uncover significant tensions regarding growth-orientation and identify further needs for empirical and conceptual research. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","B corps; Business model; Corporate organizations; Framework application; Framework development; Sustainable degrowth","Operations research; B corps; Business models; Conceptual frameworks; Corporate organization; Corporates; Degrowth; Economic growths; Framework application; Framework development; Sustainable degrowth; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104079320

This study uses framing theory to examine the effects of four message frames about transitioning to an economic paradigm not centered on economic growth. The four message frames were: environmental gain, environmental loss, well-being gain and well-being loss. The environmental loss frame generated more negative emotions, while the well-being gain frame produced more agreement with the message and more positive emotional reactions. While this study did not find evidence that the frames influenced participant's attitudes, it did confirm that the messages elicited frame-consistent thoughts, pointing to the importance of being strategic and deliberate in the frames selected for communicating post-growth ideas to the public. This study also examined initial reactions towards different economic terms that are increasingly being used to describe this transition. We found that the green economy was perceived as favourably as economic growth, indicating public support towards macroeconomic models that embed sustainability objectives. The appeal of terms like sustainable degrowth were more nuanced and mixed than what is usually suggested in academic debates. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Economic terms; Environmental frame; Message framing; Post-growth communication; Well-being frame","economic conditions; economic growth; environmental degradation; environmental economics; green economy; public attitude; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099839772

This paper argues that tackling the problem of unsustainable growth is crucial in order to mitigate the worst effects of the ecological crisis, and that proposals for decarbonisation, degrowth, and just transitions should be connected. Decarbonisation has become an urgent priority in the global climate race to reach zero emissions by 2050. However, despite increasing net zero pledges from governments, cities, and corporations, the imperative for perpetual economic growth still remains integral to global capitalism. The degrowth movement challenges the dominant paradigm of economic growth and promotes non-marketized ways of living and working, but it remains outside of mainstream economic policies and has little resonance for deindustrialized and marginalized communities. Decarbonisation faces considerable barriers due to embedded interests in fossil fuel-dependent growth. This paper examines one of the key growth obstacles to transitioning away from fossil fuels: the multiscalar problem of petrochemical lock-in, related to growing global demand for carbon-intensive plastics consumption, the use of petrochemicals in green technologies, and regional and local economic dependencies. It focuses on the emblematic case of the petrochemical town of Grangemouth in Scotland, where there is government pressure to pursue growth-led decarbonisation, and local residents and workers have started to question their dependence on fossil fuels, amidst tremendous gaps between local social and economic deprivation and petrochemical industry profits. Rather than considering the need for just transitions only after the loss of industrial jobs, visions for just petrochemical transformations need to be more proactive, speaking to wider degrowth themes of well-being, community participation, and prosperity without extractive growth. © 2021 Societa Editrice il Mulino.

It shows that the CESCR assumes economic growth to generally improve the realisation of ESC rights because it increases States’ financial capacity and leads to employment creation. However, while the Committee deems that growth models should be inclusive, the CESCR never adopts a critical perspective on the possibility or desirability to pursue economic growth indefinitely. Despite recent evidence on the contested possibility to decouple economic activity from resource use, the Committee’s recent ecological turn remains embedded in the growth paradigm.

Degrowth is a research area that aims to transcend mainstream approaches. While moving beyond the growth paradigm would entail serious changes in all areas of social life and Degrowth research extends into most of them, the transformation of sports is not among them. Neither is Degrowth a recognised concept among those who deal with sports. The participatory backcasting research introduced in this paper attempts to fill this void. In the backcasting project, master students of sports economics envisioned the sustainable future of sports and identified potential intervention steps that lead towards such normative states.

The results show that relocalisation and the sharing economy are the most accepted Degrowth concepts in a normative scenario on sustainable sports in this group.

The findings reveal that CSR certification schemes do not seem to genuinely foster the restructuring of the tourism market within the capitalist system, but can only marginally advocate and diffuse certain elements of degrowth-oriented tourism. At the same time, CSR certification schemes lack the influence necessary for a paradigm shift and for this reason the approach of degrowth-oriented tourism seems unsuitable for mainstream application. © CAB International 2021.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126419629

Policies for combining environmental and social sustainability would be sharply at odds with key mechanisms inherent in the capitalist economy. Urban sustainability thus requires profound changes. On the ontological plane, planning theory must move away from anti-realist constructivism and hermeneuticism, towards realism. On the empirical plane, it is necessary to move away from disciplinary tunnel vision towards a critical realist version of interdisciplinarity, within key research fields such as housing research and transportation research.

It is directed by governments that abide by the logic of capital. Although in principle there is civic engagement, public participation is limited and without challenging the dominant economic paradigm. Following Gramsci's terminology, sustainable development can be interpreted as a passive revolution, in the sense that change is managed through compromises with different social and political actors but within limits which neutralize any potential threat to economic and political power. On the contrary, the emerging (yet still marginal) alternative, multi-disciplinary, degrowth academic paradigm, has evolved from an activist movement since the first decade of this century, and retains close contacts and open communication with social movements that support a degrowth transition in economy and society. This transition directly challenges the established orthodox growth narrative and the mechanisms of capital accumulation. Thus, in contrast to the sustainable development discourse, it is difficult for the ""power bloc"" to accommodate degrowth. But in times of crisis and change, the dominant powers can certainly use some aspects of the degrowth discourse, assimilating and transforming them into elements that fit their new accumulation strategies, hegemonic visions and state projects. For this not to happen, degrowthers should focus their research and theory more on the workings of capitalist political economy, and their political practice on trying to form alliances with social actors, such as working-class movements, that are crucial for the achievement of hegemony. © 2021.

A paradigm shift is necessary in the economical, social and political systems to ensure the natural ecosystems preservation on the planet while fulfilling society needs. Various research methods have therefore emerged to change the way products and services are designed, developed, used and discarded considering territorial contexts. Design for Sustainability, Design for Sustainable Transition, Socially Responsible Design, post-growth design, etc. provide several methods integrating the sustainable principles in the design process. However those approaches remain mainly experimental and are limited to the industrial context. In parallel to those approaches a wide variety of grassroots initiatives have emerged in territories. They propose alternative ways to design systems and they integrate new constraints in a practical manner. This research therefore aims to confront the diversity of Design to Environment (DtE) approaches with 'grassroots' initiatives in order to understand the possible evolution of the integration of sustainability into the design process of products and services used in industry. This paper presents the first literature review results of a started project in 2020. An original research protocol is proposed in this paper, based on specific focus groups with grassroots initiatives practitioners and eco-design experts from research and industry. The presentation of four DtE frameworks are analysed in this paper. This research finally discusses the opportunity of integrating the grassroots enriched DtE frameworks by non-official-designers in life cycle engineering. This bottom-up process may drive an expression of sustainability in industry aligned with some emerging local socio-technical systems. © 2021 Elsevier B.V..

In addition, energy-economy feedbacks within an economic growth system create a rebound effect that counters the benefits of substitution.

Given the socio-ecological challenges of the Anthropocene, the concept of CE could indeed help the transition to a sustainable, just and resilient future. However, the actual definition, objectives and forms of implementation of the CE are still unclear, inconsistent, and contested. Different actors and sectors are thus articulating circular discourses which align with their interests, and which often do not sufficiently examine the ecological, social and political implications of circularity. In this context, this research asks how to better navigate and analyse the history, complexity and plurality of circularity discourses by conceptually differentiating them in a comprehensive discourse typology. To answer this question a critical literature review has been carried out, which first, examines and reflects on the core challenges, gaps and limitations of the CE concept. Second, this research develops a comprehensive timeline of circularity thinking, which identifies and conceptually classifies 72 different CE-related concepts from the Global North and South (such as Gandhian and steady-state economics, buen vivir, doughnut economics and degrowth). This leads to the development of a typology of circularity discourses, which classifies circularity visions according to their position on fundamental social, technological, political and ecological issues. This research thus seeks to provide a basis for a more inclusive and comprehensive discussion on the topic, which opens the imaginary regarding the many circular futures that can exist and allows for a cross-pollination of ideas, policy options, strategies, practices and solutions. © 2020 The Authors","Circular economy; Circular society; Critical literature review; Discourse analysis; Sustainability","Ecology; Anthropocene; Circular economy; Corporate sector; Literature reviews; Policy options; Political implications; Socio-ecological; Steady state; Economics; Anthropocene; economic system; environmental economics; recycling; circular economy; ecology; environmental economics; environmental impact; environmental planning; environmental sustainability; politics; program sustainability; recycling; Review; social aspect; social justice",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086724637

As numerous scholars have argued, an energy transition away from – rather than in addition to – fossil fuels will require more than technology and financial capital. Here we argue that a feminist perspective on energy provides an important framework for understanding what keeps us stuck in unsustainable energy cultures, as well as a paradigm for designing truly just energy systems. Feminist approaches have been widely taken up in environmental and ecofeminist work, as well as in climate change research. In energy studies, however, gender-related research has tended to focus more narrowly on women's issues. Although this is crucial work, the focus on women represents just one dimension of what feminism can bring to the study of energy. Feminist theory also offers expertise in the study of power more broadly, which is widely applicable to the full spectrum of energy research. This article outlines a feminist energy research agenda that addresses many aspects of energy system design, planning, exchange, and use. We analyze energy along four intersecting coordinates: the political (democratic, decentralized and pluralist); economic (prioritizing human well-being and biodiversity over profit and unlimited growth); socio-ecological (preferring relationality over individualism); and technological (privileging distributed and decentralized fuel power and people power). In doing so, we show that feminism is well-suited for navigating the tangled web of power, profit, and technological innovation that comprises human fuel use. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Degrowth; Ecofeminism; Energy democracy; Feminist energy; Fossil fuels; Just transition",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085170626

Many challenges outlined by the SDGs are supposed to be solved by “inclusive” or “sustainable” economic growth, assuming that economic growth can be conveniently decoupled from resource consumption. Yet, the current hegemony of the sustainability-through-growth paradigm has actually increased inequalities and pressure on natural resources, exacerbating biodiversity loss, climate change and resulting social tensions. With unreflective support for growth, far from challenging the status quo, the SDGs and consequently, the ESDGs, condone continuing environmental exploitation, depriving millions of species of their right to flourish, and impoverishing future generations.

Nonetheless, a review of international biodiversity and sustainability policies shows that the majority advocate economic growth. Since improvements in resource use efficiency have so far not allowed for absolute global reductions in resource use and pollution, we question the support for economic growth in these policies, where inadequate attention is paid to the question of how growth can be decoupled from biodiversity loss. Drawing on the literature about alternatives to economic growth, we explore this contradiction and suggest ways forward to halt global biodiversity decline. These include policy proposals to move beyond the growth paradigm while enhancing overall prosperity, which can be implemented by combining top-down and bottom-up governance across scales. Finally, we call the attention of researchers and policy makers to two immediate steps: acknowledge the conflict between economic growth and biodiversity conservation in future policies; and explore socioeconomic trajectories beyond economic growth in the next generation of biodiversity scenarios. © 2020 The Authors.

In overconsuming and overdeveloped nations, such resource and energy “degrowth” is desirable and necessary from a sustainability perspective, provided it is planned for and managed in ways consistent with basic principles of distributive equity. Working within that degrowth paradigm, we examine how scarcer and more expensive energy may impact the suburban way of life and how households might prepare for this very plausible, but challenging, energy descent future. The article examines energy demand management in suburbia and how the limited energy needed to provide for essential household services can best be secured in an era of expensive energy and climate instability. After reviewing various energy practices, we also highlight a need for an ethos of sufficiency, moderation, and radical frugality, which we argue is essential for building resilience in the face of forthcoming energy challenges and a harsher climate. © 2020 American Journal of Economics and Sociology, Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091234533

However, with its multidimensional composition and immense depth, the language of sustainability could be misinterpreted and misguide interventions. Examining macro-level literature and reliable yet different sources for information is key to developing effective social marketing programmes. In search of overlapping actions to reduce misinterpretation and misguidance, literature from degrowth and sustainable development as two constructs operating in the sustainability paradigm are thematically analysed according to the internal structure of a nomological network. Maps of each construct provide an overview of the linkages between their antecedents, components, strategies, actions outcomes and end-states from which general similarities and differences emerge. From this in-depth analysis of each construct, we find several actions that show positive overlaps in composition and linkages to their respective nomological networks. Comparing actions reveals a simpler language that is less open to misinterpretation and misguidance for social marketers. It is recommended that social marketers focus on these actions in developing effective social marketing programmes and explore them in greater detail to shape society toward a more sustainable future.

While the literature on degrowth has grown substantially, little has been said about how these transformations are understood in practice. By drawing upon practice theory and using performative methods, this paper explores the ways in which degrowth scholars and practitioners experience and understand degrowth. It provides a preliminary account of living degrowth by portraying a diverse range of interrelated practices grouped in five spheres: (1) rethinking society, (2) acting political, (3) creating alternatives, (4) fostering connections, and (5) unveiling the self. Drawing upon the spheres of practices, we conceptualize living degrowth as an endeavour that aims to transform current problems into imagined futures in multiple realms. The practices of living degrowth are concerned with theoretical, political, material, economical, social and personal dimensions of world and life. This points to the importance for sustainability science to investigate and foster transformations in all domains and at all levels, reaching from the outer to the inner and vice versa. © 2019, The Author(s).","Degrowth; Inner worlds; Performative methods; Practices; Sustainability science; Transformations",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075342480

It stands in strong opposition to mainstream thought on the operations of the economy and society. The core arguments deconstruct and oppose both growth and price-making market paradigms. However, in contradiction of these theoretical foundations, ecological economists can be found who call upon neoclassical economic theory as insightful, price-making and capitalist markets as socially justified means of allocation and economic growth as achieving progress and development. The more radical steady-state and post-growth/degrowth movements are shown to include confused and conflicted stances in relation to the mainstream hegemonic paradigms.

However, there is no consensus on what transformative strategies should look like. Within the German-language literature one can broadly distinguish two transformative paradigms: the green economy paradigm, arguing for soft political steering mechanisms and technological innovations in order to green the current economic system and the degrowth paradigm, drawing the current growth-oriented economic system into question. In both approaches a tendency to marginalize issues of quality of work prevails. We argue that work is not only an integral part of one's income, but also of one's identity and psychosocial wellbeing as well as of social peace and cohesion and that it should therefore be at the heart of socio-ecological transformative strategies. We apply these theoretical considerations to the analysis of the Smart City Vienna Framework Strategy (SCWR), which is promoted as a holistic sustainability strategy paper. Additionally, we conducted expert workshops and interviews in order to analyze how stakeholders within the sectors with the highest CO2 emissions in Vienna perceive the SCWR in relation to work. We found that the SCWR does not live up to its potential as an eco-social policy as it remains tightly rooted within the green economy paradigm and does not account for the ecological dimension of work. The stakeholders' perspectives on the SCWR vary according to the degree to which they are embedded within the green economy paradigm as well as their position within the economic system. However, generally the SCWR is not perceived as an eco-social policy and no connection is made between environmental issues and quality of work. We argue that transformative degrowth strategies could greatly benefit from making this connection explicit. © 2020 by the authors.","Decent work; Degrowth; Eco-social policy; Environmental policy; Green economy; Quality of work; Smart city wien rahmenstrategie; Socio-ecological transformation; Sustainable development; Sustainable work","economic system; environmental policy; green economy; qualitative analysis; smart city; strategic approach; sustainability; sustainable development; Austria; Vienna",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081261558

However, this policy idea ignores the environmental impacts that are now challenging human wellbeing and welfare goals. In this conceptual research article, I reframe the virtuous circle of the welfare state by revealing its unintended consequences and internal contradictions before introducing a more sustainable policy idea. I argue that this new concept—a virtuous circle of sustainable welfare—could have transformative potential in designing a planned and socially sustainable degrowth transformation. Drawing on historical institutionalism, degrowth, social policy and sustainable welfare state research, I advocate for the virtuous circle as a heuristic tool to provide an appealing and convincing narrative for sustainable welfare state beyond growth. The policy idea of virtuous circle addresses interrelated institutional reforms and positive feedbacks between different institutions and policy goals. It also emphasizes that a holistic approach is necessary to avoid trade-offs and contradictions between social, environmental, and economic policies. © 2020 by the author.

In this paper, we engage with theoretical and empirical observations to reflect on how the promise of sustainable economic growth arising from the convergence of international conservation policies and the blue growth paradigm, has failed to materialise and caused huge social and economic inequities among local fishing communities and the catastrophic disruption of the socio-ecological system of fisheries. Drawing on various interventions in Malta, we illustrate how neoliberal policies, lauded and promoted as part of a national blue growth strategy, are suffocating and marginalising small-scale fishingcommunities by concentrating fishing opportunities into fewer, larger corporate hands, and by a hegemonic anti-small scale fishing narrative that seeks to replace traditional fishing with the ‘darlings of the new blue economy’, aquaculture and coastal tourism. With artisanal-commercial fishing in Malta on the verge of extinction, we call for reversal of neo-liberal policy measures to re-create a more resilient and stable fisheries economy through specific blue degrowth measures including improved access to fisheries resources and markets, and the establishment of marine protected areas that recognize the value of small-scale fisheries to conservation. This could be achieved through equity-based governance systems, including improved profit distribution systems within community economies, that grant small-scale fisheries the possibility of re-institutionalizing their sector and promoting their existence and viability into the future. Ultimately, we demonstrate that through a blue economy roadmap for small-scale fisheries, small-islands states like Malta, can rescue an important component of their maritime traditions, and be better placed to reach the obligations set out within the United Nations sustainable development goals. © 2019, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","Community economies; Conservation policies; Neoliberalism; Redistribution; Sustainable development goals; Tuna",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077149085

The growth of the industrial fleet led to an initial increase in global catches from the 1950s to the 1990s; yet, today, several marine fish stocks are harvested at unsustainable rates, and catches are stagnating. As a result, industrial fishers increase investments and fishing effort, reaching farther and deeper, while small-scale fishers face the threat of disappearance as both their catches and livelihoods worsen. The emergent international emphasis on Blue Growth is likely to put further pressure on marine capture fisheries. This paper explores how the growth imperative in the seas has manifested itself in Turkey since the 1970s and how industrial and small-scale fishers responded to this growth spiral in the seas. Based on participant observation methods and in-depth interviews, this paper problematizes the expanding boundaries of industrial fishers and examines the reactions of small-scale fishing cooperatives in Istanbul, in particular their proposed alternative economic model, as a response to the growth imperative. Overall, the paper demonstrates that the crisis that small-scale fishers are facing not only presents economic and ecological difficulties, but also represents an existential threat to the identity and traditional ways of life as a fisher. The strategies adopted by small-scale fishers in response to this crisis in Turkey, especially in Istanbul, are politicizing fishers as they open up new spaces, collaborations, and demands for environmental, social, and economic justice. However, their efforts constitute an ongoing process prone to numerous tensions and contradictions. This paper concludes that challenging the growth paradigm in fisheries via the Blue Degrowth framework can be useful for analyzing emerging alternative imaginaries to the growth-driven capitalist economic system among small-scale fishers. © 2019, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","Alternatives; Blue Economy; Coastal fisheries; Degrowth; Food sovereignty; Industrial fisheries",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076531091

In this essay it is argued that one also needs to examine the present close to monopoly position of neoclassical economic theory at university departments of economics in many parts of the world. An open debate is needed about paradigms in economics as well as ideological orientations. An alternative to neoclassical theory is outlined where individuals and organizations are regarded as political actors, each guided by an ideological orientation or mission. Reference is made to the 17 UN sustainable development goals suggesting that impacts need to be seen in multidimensional terms and an alternative definition of economics as ""multidimensional management of limited resources in a democratic society"" is proposed. It is argued that economics need to move away from its technocracy-oriented tendencies to democracy-oriented approaches. This is exemplified by a move away from neoclassical Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) to Positional Analysis as approach to decision-making and sustainability assessment. © 2019 Rosetti International Publishing House.

The appeal of economic growth, however, goes beyond the economic sphere. As a societal goal, growth is often mobilized to pre-empt and/or co-opt opposition around issues of social justice and redistribution. Not only does the constitution of growth as a collective goal serve to unite the internally fragmented sphere of the social and brush aside (class-based) distributional conflicts, but it also enables the distribution of material concessions to subordinate classes for eliciting their consent. The degrowth proposal should thus more broadly tackle the material and discoursive ways in which growth enables the reproduction of contemporary political-economic systems. This paper argues that the notion of growth functions as a powerful ideal that shapes state–society relationships and social-collective imaginations. It demonstrates this by discussing the making of state in Turkey through a Gramscian perspective, where the notion of economic growth is deeply imprinted in the broader practices of the state to legitimize its existence and dominates the social imaginary in a way that cannot be easily dismissed. Against this backdrop, the possibility of not only effectuating, but also imagining and desiring degrowth would call for a radical reconfiguration of state–society relationships. Within this context, the Kurdish Freedom Movement’s project of Democratic Economy emerges as an alternative, both to the nation-state paradigm and to the imperative of economic growth. © The Author(s) 2019.","Degrowth; Gramsci; Kurdish Freedom Movement; state; Turkey",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082462439

We offer constructive decolonial and feminist critiques to foster their productive alliances with multiple feminisms, Indigenous, post-development and pluriversal thought and design (Escobar, 2018), and people on the ground. Our suggested pathway of decolonial transition includes re-situating degrowth relative to the global south and to Indigenous and other resistance movements. We see this decolonial degrowth as a profoundly material strategy of recovery, renewal, and resistance (resurgence) through practices of re-rooting and re-commoning. To illustrate what we mean by resurgence we draw from two examples where people are engaged in ongoing struggles to protect their territories from the impacts of rampant growth—Zapatista and allied Indigenous groups in Mexico, and three Adivasi communities in the Attappady region of southern India. They are building economies and ecologies of resurgence and simultaneous resistance to growth by deterritorialization. We argue that a decolonized degrowth must be what the growth paradigm is not, and imagine what does not yet exist: our separate and collective socio-ecological futures of sufficiency and celebration in the multiple worlds of the pluriverse. Together, the two cases demonstrate pathways to autonomy, sufficiency, and resurgence of territories and worlds, through persistence, innovation, and mobilization of traditional and new knowledges.

The currently dominant capitalist economic paradigm is seen as one such powerful belief that generates imaginaries which cannot accommodate sustainable futures. At the same time, in educational practice, social movements, and academic discussion, the perspective of degrowth has gained attention as an approach which challenges this paradigm. In this article, we address the role of education in processes of socioecological transformation in the context of degrowth. We do this from a perspective of practice, linking our experiences in non-formal education to academic discussions on education and sustainability. The aim of this article is to contribute to a pedagogy of degrowth as one path within a complex search for ways to imagine and support sustainable futures, which address root causes of the current crises. Analysing these crises as crises of conviviality, resulting from imperial modes of living and producing, we sketch the framework for sustainable futures marked by world relations of interconnectedness and solidarity. Relating a theory of transformative learning to a critical-emancipatory understanding of education, we propose two interlinked aspects for pedagogy of degrowth: creating spaces for reflection and emphasizing the political in educational settings. We discuss our practical experience as learning facilitators in non-formal educational contexts. As a cross-cutting challenge, we will touch upon the role of strengthening psychological resources in education for a degrowth society. © 2019, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","Economic paradigm; Imperial modes of living; Politicization of education; Psychological resources; Reflective learning processes; Transformative learning",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065503556

We then show how these can be connected through research and used to generate insights with the potential for application in broader, systemic change. The first realisation is that the core ambition of ecological economics, that of addressing the scale of human environmental resource use and associated impacts, often remains an aspirational goal, rather than being applied within research. In understanding intertwined environmental and social challenges, systemic approaches (including system dynamics) should be revitalised to address the full scope of what is possible or desirable. The second realisation is that the focus on biophysical and economic quantification and methods has been at the expense of a comprehensive social understanding of environmental impacts and barriers to change-including the role of power, social class, geographical location, historical change, and achieving human well-being. For instance, by fetishising growth as the core problem, attention is diverted away from underlying social drivers-monetary gains as profits, rent, or interest fuelled by capitalist competition and, ultimately, unequal power relations. The third realisation is that ecological economics situates itself with respect to mainstream (neoclassical) economics, but simultaneously adopts some of its mandate and blind spots, even in its more progressive camps. Pragmatic attempts to adopt mainstream concepts and tools often comfort, rather than challenge, the reproduction of the very power relations that stand in the way of sustainability transitions. We consider these three realisations as impediments for developing ecological economics as an emancipatory critical research paradigm and political project. We will not focus on or detail the failings of ecological economics, but state what we believe they are and reformulate them as research priorities. By describing and bringing these three elements together, we are able to outline an ambitious research agenda for ecological economics, one capable of catalysing real social change. © 2019 by the authors.","Capital; Degrowth; Marxian political economy; Neoclassical economics; Planetary boundaries; Systems of provision; Systems perspectives; Value; Well-being","boundary layer; capital; ecological economics; historical geography; Marxism; neoclassical theory; political discourse; power relations; resource use; social status; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064046522

The post-growth world, while subject to significant uncertainty and heterogeneity, will be characterized by profound hazards and discontinuities for both human and natural systems.

Interestingly, although Africa contributes less greenhouse gas emissions (that lead to climate change) than more developed continents, it is one of the most vulnerable continents when faced with climate change. International stakeholders are motivated to implement climate change adaptation strategies, e.g. sustainable development and the introduction of genetically modified crops in Africa’s agricultural sector, to lower the continent’s vulnerability. However, when developing and implementing adaptation strategies, cognizance must be allocated to the unique cultural values of various stakeholders. This is often not the case as cultural value systems of communities are neglected in these processes, e.g. the African values system of Ubuntu (which focuses on relationality). It is imperative to investigate and compare individualistic-capitalistic Western values (with its focus on sustainable development and economic growth) and the values of Ubuntu as it pertains to environmental ethics. Both value systems attribute different significance to relationality between humans, non-humans, and the natural environment. From this, I argue that the individualistic-capitalistic West has much to learn from Africa’s Ubuntu and the ensuing potential for climate change adaptation. Subsequently, a call for a universal paradigm shift will be made, away from the economic and development foci of individualistic-capitalistic values, towards Ubuntu degrowth which prioritizes communitarianism, and the principle of sufficiency. I suggest that relevant and diverse stakeholders meet around the “global roundtable” to consider and discuss different perspectives and cultural values when developing climate change adaptation strategies on a global level. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101505568

Still, there are at least two views of the human-divine relationship that have implications for environmental ethics. The first and most popular view argues that the human-divine relationship is mediated by the human-in-community relationship.

The analysis reveals a policy interdependence between international economic law and sustainable development. The latter hence represents a specific regulatory construct that aims at compensating the losses of exhaustible resources with investments in technology and knowledge. This, however, merely justifies and legitimizes the over-exploitation of certain parts of the globe, including not only their natural resources, but also human and other capitals. To overcome these unsustainable models, the article proposes a paradigm shift away from the standard of sustainable development in international economic law, towards one of sustainability.

Specifically, we investigate potential transition barriers within three case studies. First, unemployment represents the most commonly cited reason why economic growth is considered indispensable. Second, alternative indicators to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) have not succeeded in replacing GDP as a standard metric of economic welfare. Third, pension schemes rely on economic growth to offset demographic change. In each of these three examples, we identify actor-interest constellations that foster the status quo of a growth economy. We conclude that compensating some of those actors who would presumably be worse off in a post-growth economy may be necessary – though not sufficient – for a transition. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",,"demography; economic growth; Gross Domestic Product; identification method; market transition; pension system; political economy; unemployment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049656421

In a second step formalized arguments from the point of view of applied ethics are articulated and applied to three Climate Engineering Technologies: Sulfate Aerosol Injection, Bio-energy with Carbon Capture and Storage, and Afforestation. In a third step, an extended version of the trade-off argument about mitigation versus Climate Engineering solution is discussed from a degrowth perspective: accordingly, within the current dominant growth paradigm, climate engineering technologies might lead to reduced mitigation efforts. The paper follows the argumentative turn in applied ethics and displays a formalization of arguments that can help clarify decision-making and identify the different dimensions at stake. The paper articulates arguments against the deployment of CE technologies and advances a new version of the trade-off-argument based on a degrowth perspective.

In these controversies, ‘futurity framing’ may open up debates for alternative paradigms such as ‘degrowth,’ which is the pursuing of collective and deliberative, downscaled production of (natural) resources and less consumption for convivial living. Based on a frame analysis, it is demonstrated that opponents and proponents of fracking have envisaged pessimistic energy futures either to promote or devaluate fracking technology. In addition, the results show that dominant technological enthusiasm has enabled the introduction of ‘degrowth technology,’ which are downscaled, decentralized and renewable energy technologies. Degrowth-technology framing may provide a means of access for more radical degrowth thinking in the energy debates. This empirical finding also indicates that the degrowth paradigm could include controversies as entry points for creating support for degrowth thinking. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Degrowth; Framing; Hydraulic fracturing; Shale gas; Socio-technological futures; Technology","Renewable energy resources; Shale; Shale gas; Degrowth; Empirical findings; Energy future; Frame analysis; Framing; Netherlands; Renewable energy technologies; Socio-technological futures; Hydraulic fracturing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019571095

This paper develops a critical and diversified viewpoint on technology for degrowth. ‘Classical perspectives’ of Illich's convivial society, Elull's critique of technique, Mumford's tools and machines, and Schumacher's critique of gigantic techno-infrastructures are explored and combined with Arendt's instrumentality of technologies and Marxist perspectives on ownership. Two questions are posed regarding technology. First, which technologies are ‘suitable’ for a degrowth context? Previous frameworks by Illich and Schumacher are extended by ecological aspects to assess the suitability of technologies. Second, how should ‘suitable’ technologies be structured to enable egalitarian utilization? Here, Schumacher's “intermediate technologies” and ownership are central elements. The frameworks and analysis add value for degrowth activists and bridge the gap scientifically between Marxist views and those of degrowth. In conclusion, technologies in degrowth are suitable if they reduce ecological impact, enhance autonomy and conviviality, and are structurally available in an egalitarian way based on open-access regimes. In the discussion further research questions are posed regarding transforming agents and power relations between grassroots and the state. Limitations of the framework include the role of digital technologies for communication, here treated as electric tools, and the focus on industrialized societies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,"Ecology; Economics; Efficiency; Digital technologies; Ecological aspects; Ecological impacts; Economic growths; Power relations; Research questions; Social inequalities; Technological efficiency; Electric tools",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018630620

Within this a hegemonic framing of innovation is emerging that leverages the language of inclusion to promote connection to, and participation in, the global free market economy. This, we hypothesise is closing down a broader debate concerning the goals and roles of innovation and technology in the so called developing world. At the same time, our research suggests that this emerging hegemony is contested, presenting as alternative, minority framings with different normative underpinnings for technology and innovation that challenge the pro-growth and market-led dominant paradigm. We present the results of one of these through a qualitative in-depth case study conducted in the Indian state of Kerala. The case provides interesting insights for the degrowth community in two regards. First it shows a concrete example of an alternative framing of technology underpinned by a set of normative principles connected to those of degrowth. Second, the case shows that alternative technological paradigms based on principles aligned with those of degrowth are not only possible, but can and do co-exist with the hegemonic paradigm. © 2016","Degrowth from the Global South; Discourse of development; Technological innovation","Commerce; Developing countries; Degrowth; Developing world; Discourse of development; Free market economy; Innovation and technology; Kerala , India; Research focus; Technological innovation; Engineering research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84996602459

Design/methodology/approach: The paper first explains its general outline and then explores different strands of literature to arrive at its analytical conclusions. Findings: Pursuing the three storylines in a paradigmatic articulation creates paradoxes. The growth paradigm focuses on economic growth as its main goal. To overcome environmental degradation, products have to be substituted by environmentally friendly alternatives, but the continuous substitution of finite resources seems unlikely possible. The storyline of innovation sees technological development as a driver of economic progress, and holds that innovations allow the decoupling of economic growth from environmental impact, a claim that is compromised by the occurrence of rebound effects. The degrowth storyline holds that economic growth has to be stopped altogether, but is unclear how this can be done. Originality/value: By articulating paradigmatic perspectives as storylines, a new understanding on how these perspectives can be figured as a constructive repertoire of guiding visions and not as mere theory-based descriptions. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Degrowth; Growth paradigm; Imaginaries; Innovation; Lock-in; Rebound; Sufficiency",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053204574

This idea presents an attack on the economic growth paradigm, and it has thus raised considerable attention. Yet, although many agree with questioning economic growth, a debate continues as to whether the term “degrowth” is (dis)advantageous in wider public communications. This debate, however, lacks empirical evidence. Here, we present two studies on how “degrowth” is perceived compared to other relevant terms. In Study 1, we show that “degrowth” elicits more negative affective and emotional reactions compared to “post-growth” and “prosperity without growth.” In Study 2, we find that the effects of labeling on attitudes and voting intentions toward a sustainable economy are relatively small. These initial results suggest that “degrowth” may evoke somewhat more negative emotional reactions than similar terms, but this may not have significant consequences.

It uses an adapted framework of the “ICE model” to illustrate how ecological processes and caring activities are structurally devalued by the monetized economy in a growth paradigm. On the one hand, this paradigm perpetuates gender injustices by reinforcing dualisms and devaluing care. On the other hand, environmental injustices are perpetuated since “green growth” does not succeed in dematerializing production processes. In its critique of the growth imperative, degrowth not only promotes the alleviation of environmental injustices but also calls for a recentering of society around care.

This argument is supported by contrasting the growth ideology with the counter-hegemonic degrowth ideology in terms of how well-being, environmental sustainability and equity are interpreted and approached. Furthermore, in order to provide an insight on how urban development plans are committed to and shaped by the growth ideology the case of Greater Copenhagen is analysed and scrutinised.

In most discussions on degrowth, economic activity has been reduced to relatively marginal activities. We see a need to connect degrowth to more typical business activities, because business is an essential part of the modern world. We put forward seven criteria which can be used to assess whether a company follows the degrowth paradigm: (1) Alternative understanding of business; (2) From business activity to activism and social movement; (3) Collaborative value creation; (4) Democratic governance; (5) Corporate leaders’ commitment to company values in personal life; (6) Reduction of environmental impacts at all stages of product/service life-cycle; (7) Making products that last and are repairable. We use these criteria to assess the performance of a case study company, Patagonia, which is known for its environmental and social record. Our assessment is not meant to be comprehensive, but to illustrate the relevance of the seven criteria. Our criteria offer guidance for aligning business activity with the broader degrowth objectives, and our analysis complements the recommendations made so far for degrowth in national and local policies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Apparel industry; Business model for sustainability; Degrowth; Operationalization; Patagonia (company); Steady-state economy","Economics; Environmental impact; Life cycle; Apparel industry; Business modeling; Degrowth; Operationalization; Patagonia; Steady state; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041128380

The chapter criticises arguments opposing localist approaches to the spatial organisation of human settlements in ecological and degrowth thinking. A more differentiated vision is put - abandoning the tabula rasa approach of any universal model for the ideal spatial organisation of society for several reasons. First, due the material cost of rebuilding from scratch everything for an ideal city or an ideal village. Second, because risks of failure appear massive. Third, such a wholesale transition is incompatible with the short period available if degrowth is to address problems such as climate change. Fourth, and most importantly, such approaches are based on an ignorance of geography. Therefore, ‘What is the right solution, the city or the (eco)village?' - ‘It depends!' Place-dependent solutions need to consider context, start from the existing situation and take into account each place’s natural and human geography and the function(s) that each human settlement has and/or shall assume. ‘Nowtopias’, real anticipations of potential degrowth practices, are supported in both rural and in urban contexts. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Anitra Nelson and François Schneider.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094909498

Originating among early modern legal scholars, the assumption that the paradigm form of ownership was of land has been inherited by later theorists. The 'tragedy of the commons' thesis, for example, conflates the absence of stock ownership with the absence of flow ownership, and several commons scholars have now started to move away from a stock-centric conception of ownership. The same assumption has also been inherited by theorists applying Heinsohn and Steiger's 'property economics' to theories of degrowth. Here, I recast their theory to include ownership of flows as well as stocks, answering critics who point out that their theory cannot account for unsecured debts. This recasting places greater focus on the different ways in which ownership institutions not only assign an owner to a resource, but also motivate the transfer of resources between individuals. This prompts a new way to frame a key question for theorists of degrowth: in a nongrowing economy where fewer transfers can be motivated by the likelihood of receiving returns on loans, will this result in more possessive behaviours, in more communal ownership norms of reciprocity, or in more command ownership through coercion and status? Existing theory, focussed on stocks, groups these different institutions together as 'private' or 'nonproperty' ownership. This article suggests that disambiguation of the different 'nonproperty' institutions that govern the ownership and transfer of resource flows is key to better understanding the political and institutional implications of degrowth. © 2018 Journal of Political Ecology.Depuis longtemps, les théories de la possession ont été centrées sur les institutions régissant les stocks de ressources telles que la terre, et ont largement négligé la possession des flux de ressources tels que les récoltes qui en découlent. D'origine parmi les premiers juristes modernes, la supposition que le paradigme de la possession était la possession de la terre a été héritée par les théoriciens qui ont suivi. La thèse de la «tragédie des biens communs», par exemple, confond l'absence de la possession des stocks avec l'absence de possession des flux, et maintenant plusieurs chercheurs des biens communs ont commencé à s'éloigner d'une conception stock-centrique de la possession. La même supposition a également été héritée par des théoriciens appliquant «l'economie de la propriété» de Heinsohn et Steiger aux théories de la décroissance. Ici, je reformule leur théorie pour inclure la propriété des flux ainsi que des stocks, en répondant aux critiques qui font remarquer que leur théorie ne peut pas prendre en compte les dettes non garanties. Cette reformulation met davantage l'accent sur les différentes manières dont les institutions de possession attribuent non seulement un possesseur à une ressource, mais motivent également le transfert de ressources entre individus. Ceci suggère une nouvelle façon de poser une question clé pour les théoriciens de la décroissance: dans une économie qui ne croît pas, où moins de transferts peuvent être motivés par la probabilité de recevoir des rendements sur des prêts, cela entraînera-t-il des comportements plus possessifs, des normes de réciprocité relatives à la possession communale, ou plus de possession de commande par la coercition et le statut? La théorie actuelle, axée sur les stocks, regroupe ces différentes institutions en tant que «privés» ou «non propriétaires». Cet article suggère que la désambiguïsation des différentes institutions de «non-propriété» qui régissent la possession et le transfert des flux de ressources est essentielle pour mieux comprendre les implications politiques et institutionnelles de la décroissance. © 2018 Journal of Political Ecology.Las teorías sobre la posesión se han centrado durante mucho tiempo en las instituciones que gobiernan las recursos stock, como la tierra, y han descuidado en gran medida la posesión de los flujos de recursos, como la cosecha que fluye de esa tierra. Originada entre los primeros eruditos legales modernos, la suposición de que la forma paradigmática de posesión era de la tierra ha sido heredada por teóricos posteriores. La tesis de la 'tragedia de los bienes comunes', por ejemplo, confund la ausencia de posesión de stocks con la ausencia de posesión de flujo, y ahora varios investigadores de los bienes comune han comenzado a alejarse de una concepción de posesión centrada en stocks. La misma suposición también ha sido heredada por los teóricos que aplican la ""economía de la propiedad"" de Heinsohn y Steiger a las teorías del decrecimiento. Aquí, reformulo su teoría para incluir la propiedad de los flujos así como las stocks, respondiendo a los críticos que señalan que su teoría no puede explicar las préstamos no aseguradas. Esta reformulación pone mayor énfasis en las diferentes maneras en que las instituciones de posesión no solo asignan un propietario a un recurso, sino que también motivan la transferencia de recursos entre individuos. Esto genera una nueva forma de formular una pregunta clave para los teóricos del decrecimiento: en una economía que no está en crecimiento, donde menos transferencias pueden ser motivadas por la probabilidad de recibir rendimientos de los préstamos, ¿esto resultará en comportamientos más posesivos, en normas de propiedad más comunitarias de reciprocidad, o más propiedad del mando a través de la compulción y el status? La teoría actual, centrada en las acciones, agrupa a estas diferentes instituciones como propiedad 'privada' o 'no propiedad'.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors integrate multidisciplinary insights from marketing, sociology, environmental sciences, management and economics, to understand the inherent tensions between unchecked firm growth, consumption and sustainability. Five propositions link production, consumption and marketing from a resource standpoint. Findings: A ceaseless economic growth paradigm and overconsumption causes an unwarranted depletion of resources and is at odds with sustainability. Firms can play an important role by guiding future marketing and production toward sustainable ends. Several alternate perspectives support the case that growth may coexist and align with sustainable consumption. Consequently the authors consolidate and reflect on seven approaches (voluntary simplicity, humane consumption, CSR 2.0, social marketing, marketing 3.0, anti-positional economy and degrowth) that hold promise for achieving sustainability via responsible growth and consumption. Originality/value: The authors consider the complex triad of growth, consumption and sustainability that spans multiple levels. A focus on the pattern and nature of growth and consumption helps to identify its effects on sustainability. Specifically, two value chain activities – production and marketing may be leveraged as firm level initiatives to achieve sustainable goals. In addition, the authors present seven heterogeneous perspectives that complement firm attempts to achieve growth with sustainable consumption. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Growth; Multidisciplinary; Sustainable consumption",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049178465

Consequently, it is in the interest of public health to actively shape a socio-economic transformation towards a system that is not based on growth. ""Degrowth"" provides coherent guidelines for such a system. Combining existing scholarship from the degrowth and the public health fields, this paper makes seven suggestions for a public health agenda towards sustainable health: (1) to develop an index of health status in relation to present and future health burden; (2) to reduce the resource burden of medical therapy; (3) to translate increased productivity to fewer working hours and more free time instead of more income and material consumption; (4) to make use of non-conventional knowledge and non-commercial forms of work and product exchange; (5) to make knowledge freely available, making use of innovative research frameworks such as open source drug research; (6) to relocalize economic life and health-related organization and to reshape citizen participation and (7) to reduce socio-economic inequality through redistribution. Generally, this paper argues that it is time for discussions on degrowth to enter the mainstream medical and health community and for doctors and other health workers to acknowledge that they have a significant role to play and important experience to contribute when our societies face the upcoming challenge of no-longer-growing economies. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","degrowth; drug production; equity; public health; social determinants of health",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017116475

However, an overview taking stock of the peer-refereed degrowth literature is yet missing. Here, we review 91 articles that were published between 2006 and 2015. We find that the academic degrowth discourse occupies a small but expanding niche at the intersection of social and applied environmental sciences. The discourse is shaped by authors from high-income, mainly Mediterranean, countries. Until 2012, articles largely constitute conceptual essays endorsed by normative claims. More recently, degrowth has branched out into modelling, empirical assessments, and the study of concrete implementations. Authors tend to agree in that economic growth cannot be sustained ad infinitum on a resource constraint planet and that degrowth requires far reaching societal change. Whether degrowth should be considered as a collectively consented choice or an environmentally-imposed inevitability constitutes a major debate among degrowth thinkers. We argue that the academic discourse could benefit from rigid hypotheses testing through input-output modelling, material flow analysis, life-cycle assessments, or social surveys. By analyzing the potentials for non-market value creation and identifying concrete well-being benefits, the degrowth discourse could receive wider public support and contribute to a paradigmatic change in the social sciences. © 2017 The Authors","Degrowth; Economic growth; Steady-state economy; Sustainable development","academic research; conceptual framework; ecological economics; economic growth; empirical analysis; hypothesis testing; interdisciplinary approach; social movement; steady-state equilibrium; sustainable development; Mediterranean Region",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017144001

By focusing on the mixed legacy of growth, both as a major source of expanded life expectancies and increased comfort, and as a destructive force harming personal livelihoods and threatening entire societies in the future, the editors seek to provide historical depth to the ongoing discussion on suitable principles of present and future global development. History of the Future of Economic Growth is aimed at students and academics in environmental, social, economic and international history, political science, environmental studies, and economics, as well as those interested in ongoing discussions about growth, sustainable development, degrowth, and, more generally, the future. © 2017 selection and editorial matter, Iris Borowy and Matthias Schmelzer; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021962163

Yet, its exhaustion seems to coincide with the rebirth of several ideas reminiscent of earlier, more radical currents of eco-political thought: liberation from capitalism, consumerism and the logic of growth. May the exhaustion of the sustainability paradigm finally re-open the intellectual and political space for the big push beyond the established socio-economic order? Looking from the perspective of social and eco-political theory, this article argues that the new narratives (and social practices) of postcapitalism, degrowth and post-consumerism cannot plausibly be read as signalling a new eco-political departure. It suggests that beyond the exhaustion of the sustainability paradigm, we are witnessing, more than anything, the further advancement of the politics of unsustainability and that in this politics the new narratives of hope may themselves be playing a crucial role. © 2017 The Author(s).","Denial; Politics of unsustainability; Rebirth of radical ecology; Simulation; Third modernity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019546542

The concentration of renewal projects in well-connected neighbourhoods is meant to sustain the mobilities of an ageing society. Such policies actually have the effect of promoting a selective redevelopment of Japan's metropolises, especially focused on maintaining the competitiveness of Tokyo's world city status. This 'Tokyo problem' is destabilising the Osaka-Kyoto-Kobe city-region (Keihanshin), whose restructurings can be read in the changing mobilities of its inhabitants. Mapping degrowth within the Keihanshin provides insights into the complex interactions between advanced demographic transition and urban dynamics in a region renowned for its mass transit system. Based upon micro-census data, this paper questions the ways in which the urban recentralisation paradigm contributes to the decline of formerly expanding suburbs and to more differentiated levels of access to urban resources.","ageing; Developmental state; Japan; Keihanshin (Osaka-Kyoto-Kobe); mobilities; suburbs; urban recentralisation; urban shrinkage","aging population; counterurbanization; metropolitan area; neighborhood; public transport; strategic approach; suburban area; urban planning; urban renewal; Honshu; Hyogo; Japan; Keihanshin; Kinki; Kobe; Kyoto [Kinki]; Kyoto [Kyoto (PRF)]; Osaka [Kinki]; Osaka [Osaka (PRF)]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013471742

The current crisis reveals that, contrary to this tradition, the institutions in office and the antagonistic way of thinking now share the same basic ‘horizontal’ form. The degrowth project represents a paradigmatic example of this structural homology. The ecological and social crises, standing at the origins of the political engagement for degrowth, are not the outcome of execrable ‘values’ but mainly of the ‘horizontal’ form adopted by current institutions. In fact, the horizontal regime is uninterested in the promotion of specific values or ideas of justice. It only ensures that each singularity (the citizen and their networks) can freely play their game on the basis of their own values. This indifference is the basic reason for ecological, social and economic deregulation. The paradox of degrowth is that, on the one hand, it evokes the necessity of a return to ‘vertical’ regulation (i.e. collective sovereignty), while on the other, it is deeply subaltern to the paradigm of horizontalism (the same that frames the growth regime). © 2016 The White Horse Press.","Degrowth; Horizontalism; Mediterranean area; Values vs. form; Verticalism","coping strategy; economic analysis; environmental values; paradigm shift; Mediterranean Region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84986907361

It lacks, however, a broad perspective on public opinion. Prior opinion surveys typically offered a simple dichotomous choice between growth and environmental protection. This study examines public beliefs and attitudes about a wider range of aspects of the growth debate. To this end, we conducted an online questionnaire survey including a country-wide, representative sample of 1008 Spanish citizens. Using factor analysis, we identify six distinct dimensions of public attitudes, referred to as: prosperity with growth; environmental limits to growth; general optimism; wrong priority; overrated GDP; and governmental control. We further analyze several specific questions associated with the growth debate, such as those concerning the desired GDP growth rate, the preferred growth-environment position, and beliefs about, as well as reasons for, a possible end or continuation of growth. We find that most respondents favor GDP growth rates of more than 3%. A majority views growth and environmental sustainability as compatible (green growth), while about one-third prefers either ignoring growth as a policy aim (agrowth), or stopping it altogether (degrowth). Only very few people want growth unconditionally (growth-at-all-costs). About one-third of the respondents believe that growth may be never-ending. We examine how support for or disagreement with different statements on growth are related to each other, as well as how they are influenced by socio-demographic, knowledge and ideology/values variables. Overall, our findings can inform public debates about the growth paradigm and its potential alternatives by providing a more nuanced understanding of public opinion. We make suggestions for future research, including modifying poll questions on growth and environment through offering a more diverse set of response options. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate change; Economic growth; Environmental sustainability; Growth debate; Limits to growth; Public opinion","attitudinal survey; climate change; economic growth; environmental economics; environmental policy; environmental protection; Gross Domestic Product; knowledge; public attitude; questionnaire survey; sustainable development; trade-environment relations; World Wide Web",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963690573

To challenge the economic growth paradigm, the concept and term ""degrowth"" has recently been embraced by various activists and scholars. Drawing on a body of evidence from cognitive science, psychology, and related fields, we argue that using the word degrowth might be disadvantageous in public communications about alternatives to growth. We begin by reviewing arguments in favor of the term. Then we outline three main counterarguments: First, degrowth has a downward orientation which triggers negative initial feelings due to the basic conceptual metaphor ""up is good-down is bad"". This puts advocates of an alternative to the growth paradigm in an unfavorable starting position, given that subsequent thought will be unconsciously biased by the initial feeling. Second, more conscious reactions are likely to be negative as well because people unfamiliar with the term will (mis)interpret it as a contraction of the economy, even though it is not always meant as such. Third, degrowth repeats and possibly strengthens the growth frame and may activate undesirable frames associated with economic recessions. To conclude, we briefly discuss alternative terms and summarize key aspects to be considered for more effective communication. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Cognition; Degrowth; Growth-versus-environment debate; Language; Public understanding; Snap judgment","cognition; communication; conceptual framework; ecological economics; economic growth; language; paradigm shift",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963490973

Following the degrowth argument, the advancement of human well-being calls for a shift from growth-based societies to ones grounded in the ethos of degrowth. In this regard, we acknowledge the necessity for both theoretical principles and examples of good practice, which can lead to this transition. To this end, the article combines some of the underlying principles of the degrowth paradigm (i.e. decolonisation of the imaginary, reciprocity and conviviality, and environmental sustainability) with those of Critical Community Psychology, as well as, in one case, of Liberation Psychology (i.e. conscientisation and de-ideologisation, responsible togetherness, and environmental justice). This integration intends to equip academic scholars, practitioners, and social activists with visions and practices for the implementation of strategic actions aimed at individual and social well-being. The article concludes with a thorough reflection on social justice and how to better promote it through the combined contributions of both degrowth and Critical Community psychology. © 2016.","Critical community psychology; Decolonisation of the imaginary; Degrowth; Reciprocity; Social justice; Well-being","ideology; psychology; social justice; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962423525

This paper draws on existing real-world cases to examine what arguments drawn from ecological economics might contribute to the discussion of RI.

This battle shows that, although the twenty-first centurys scenarios of a sustainable future may vary, the common rallying cry is most often for the mobilization of modernitys innovative potential to get the planet out of its current predicament, and less so the idea of a return to a Spartan, pre-modern nature-utopia. There is now a plethora of concepts describing the greening of modernity, from sustainable development, ecological modernization, green growth and transformation to the post-growth, no-growth or even de-growth economy. The paper contends that it is time to put these concepts-and their accompanying practices-into dialogue with one another and imbue them with an overarching cultural objective. The suggested concept of ecomodernity reconciles the modernity of the Enlightenment with a return to oikos-the ancient concept of the more-than-human household or natural home-reclaiming the discarded connection between humans and nature. The paper drafts the cultural contours of ecomodernity in terms of a pivotal paradigm shift in education, which involves redefining human identity, reimagining the balance between competition and cooperation, and supplementing knowledge with wisdom. © 2016 Norwegian Institute of International Affairs (NUPI).","Ecological modernization; Education; Environmental ethics; Green growth; Modernity; Sustainable development","environmental economics; environmental education; ethics; modernization; sustainability; sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959340253

Such goals actually reflect a re-scaling of the Japanese developmental state, now focused on sustaining Tokyo's global competitiveness and prioritizing the revitalization of the country's metropolitan cores, at the expense of the rest of Japan. This ""Tokyo problem"" is even destabilizing the Osaka-Kyoto-Kobe city-region (Keihanshin), whose social and spatial restructurings can be observed in its inhabitants' changing daily mobilities. Therefore, a geographical approach to population degrowth and to the evolution of daily mobilities within the Keihanshin provides an original insight into the complex interactions between an advanced stage of demographic transition, urban dynamics and mobilities in a metropolitan region renowned for its dense mass transit system. Based upon maps of statistical data stemming from national censuses and public transportation surveys, this paper raises questions about the ways in which the urban recentralization ( toshin kaiki) paradigm actually contributes to suburban decline, as it accelerates the obsolescence of a postwar residential model geared towards the acquisition of real estate in suburban areas. This study underlines a resulting differentiation of mobility behaviours between city-centres and suburbs, greater than during the era of urban sprawl that lasted until the Lost Decade (1991-2002), when the collapse of land markets and the resulting socio-economic crisis deeply changed Japanese lives.","Aging; Developmental state; Japan; Mobilities; Suburbs; Urban recentralization; Urban shrinkage","aging population; demography; mobility; population decline; population density; suburban area; urban population; Honshu; Hyogo; Japan; Kinki; Kobe; Kyoto [Kinki]; Kyoto [Kyoto (PRF)]; Osaka [Kinki]; Osaka [Osaka (PRF)]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994225801

My chapter offers another angle on the “transnational trajectories” in East Asia by considering the cross-border dynamics of Japanese modern and contemporary art-and particularly the international mobility of artists-as part of an Asian-led cultural globalization. It is widely accepted that the economic rise of Asia in recent decades has in effect produced an alternative Asian modernity (or modernities) that is capable of challenging American and European global hegemony, not only economically or politically, but also in terms of cultural production. In this, clearly, Japan was a leader (see, for example, Clammer 1997). Having absorbed the Western lessons of modernization in its emergence as a modern nation state in the early part of the twentieth century, and then as a global economic power from the 1960s onwards, in the 1970s and 1980s it began to produce innovative and distinctive variations on modern global culture that swept through both regional and global markets (Iwabuchi 2002, Moeran 2000). Japan became a globally visible producer of new culture, not only in terms of the wildly popular culture of anime (animated cartoons), manga (comics), tv and film, toys, electronic games, and brand characters-Godzilla, Pokemon, Hello Kitty, and all that (Allison 2006, Kelts 2006)-but also the “high culture” branches of, for example, contemporary design, catwalk fashion, and architecture (Japan Foundation 2008, Kawamura 2004, Koolhaas and Obrist 2011). Japan in effect patented a model of Asian modernity that, in the 1990s and 2000s, has become a path for others: pop culture from Hong Kong, K-Pop from Korea, Singapore or Taipei as creative cities and, above all, the rise of China. The production, consumption, and appreciation of contemporary art from Asia is another key index of this so-called “world class” modernity. In the 1990s and 2000s, indeed, it might be argued that contemporary art became the quintessential global high culture, a form of culture itself very characteristic of the era’s global capitalism. The globalization of contemporary art produced an apparently borderless global art world that stretched from the auction halls of New York and London, via the high art temples of MOMA, Tate and Pompidou, to the new museums of Istanbul and Dubai, and the biennials and art fairs of East Asia. In parallel with the deregulated markets and finance knocking down national borders, the free-spirited avant garde intellectual discourse of artists and art curators complimented perfectly the free-moving money of venture capitalists who bought the works or built the museums (Stallabrass 2004). Amidst a vast inflationary boom, contemporary art became the calling card for newly rich oligarchs in emerging economies everywhere, as well as the signature form of city branding for “global cities” the world over. It might even be argued-as captured beautifully in the ethnography of this world by Sarah Thornton (2008)-that contemporary art became a truly sublime form of the global, approaching a new religion for the secular, atheist, “post-modern” elites that followed and believed in it. Part of this story was an Asian art boom as the world discovered new Asian art and artists, a boom unquestionably centered on Chinese artists but which progressively involved many other sources of origin (Chiu and Genocchio 2010, Ciotti 2012, Philipsen 2008, Vine 2011). The presence of Asian artists on the global market and the curatorial and museum prestige which has been invested in their works, alongside the physical location of many huge global events (such as art fairs and auctions in Hong Kong, or biennials in Shanghai and Singapore), might be seen simply as affirming the rise of a truly de-centered, de-colonized contemporary world or global art sensibility; something that might be identified with the “cosmopolitan imagination” identified by recent critical social theory (Delanty 2009, Papastergiadis 2012). Western art history as a discipline has been very slow to question its own ethnocentric assumptions, but in the wake of this world art boom, there has been a veritable deluge of reflection in these terms on globalization in art theory (Harris 2011). This reflection was, of course, the back end of the post-colonial critique which swept across the humanities since the 1960s. Yet the self-styled “cosmopolitan” global art of the 1990s and 2000s was at the same so patently anchored in the economic liberalism of rampant global capitalism of that era (see also Kofman 2005). As the sublime, utopian form of these material global forces, contemporary art could-to echo the famous works of Hardt and Negri (2001, 2005)-in effect unify both “empire” and “multitude” in the critical discourses of the free-moving global curators who very self-consciously selected, promoted and put (extraordinary) value on the art from new, non-Western sources. The most fashionable Asian artists might slam global capitalism or evoke universal environmental ideals, but those selected for stardom on the global art market or museum circuit often looked very similar as they were presented for global consumption. Superstar new Asian artists such as the Chinese Ai Weiwei or the Indian Subodh Gupta were always positioned as liberal, cosmopolitan heroes, critiquing the forces of modernization sweeping their countries as well as their restrictive political regimes, yet producing very nationally specific icons and images of their home countries that could be easily packaged into simple sociological lessons about exotic (and sometimes still dangerous) locations to curious Western viewers and buyers. The cosmopolitanism of the new global art, and its selective presentation, may thus easily be questioned as a sophisticated new form of orientalism that was not challenging the global order anywhere near as radically as supposed. Behind the apparently free-flowing global circuit, for all the new Asian talent it could also be seen that the personnel powering this world-the institutional “art power” of top curators, dealers, collectors and art writers-were still as solidly as ever anchored in the usual Western hub locations (Quemin 2006). The story with global contemporary art in East Asia, though, is complicated by the positioning of Japan in this picture. Japanese artists were among the first to be presented as part of the “discovery” of world art in the late 1980s, a moment usually linked with the famous Magiciens de la Terre show, curated by Jean-Hubert Martin at the Pompidou, Paris in 1989 (McLean 2011). Yet although a vibrant commercial and conceptual contemporary art scene has continued to develop in Japan during the next two decades, Japanese contemporary artists have been surprisingly marginal to the Asian art boom in global art. This is a long and complex story, but it is largely because the Western global curators have been unable to get in to Japan and shape the contemporary art scene as they have in China. With one or two notable exceptions, then, Japanese artists have been neglected in global art history narratives of the 1990s and 2000s. The perfect evidence is the canonical handbook of modern Western art history, Art Since 1900, edited by the five ruling modern art historians of the East Coast Ivy League: Hal Foster, Rosalind Krauss, Yve-Alain Bois, Benjamin H. D. Buchloh, and David Joselit (Foster et al. 2011). Only one Japanese contemporary artist since the 1960s is discussed. That artist is, of course, Takashi Murakami: Japan’s version of Ai Weiwei or Subodh Gupta, Japan’s only true global superstar artist since 1990, who is central to my story below. The dominant Western narrative is, to say the least, not a representative history from a Japanese point of view (Favell 2012).1 And despite all the talk about global art and cosmopolitan sensibilities, the “national” point of view is still very relevant here because it does not align with the global view. This in fact is also a peculiarly distinct feature of Japanese contemporary art in comparison to other Asian countries, whose art has been assimilated more easily into global art theories and narratives. At the same time, Japan’s relative neglect is also symptomatic of the Japanese art world’s long history of self-understanding and positioning in relation to Western modernity (Clark 1998). The story of Japanese modern and contemporary art in relation to transnational flows and mobilities indeed reveals an ambivalent globalization. It suggests that, in this field of cultural production at least, Japan has preserved a certain independence, less obviously dominated or colonized by global forces. And that by analyzing the international mobility of Japanese artists it is possible to chart the changing forms of both cosmopolitanism and nationhood in the ways their experiences have been expressed through artistic forms. The chapter proceeds as follows. In the first section, I take the story back to the historical pre-World War Two origins of modernist Japanese art, tracing the role of self-positioning in relation to Western modernity and the dynamics of international mobility and return in international Japanese artists’ careers. This introduces the notion of the gaisen ko-en (the “triumphant return performance”)- that is, the acclaim at home after perceived success on a tour abroad-which has hitherto always been thought necessary to cement a Japanese artist’s international (i.e. “world class”) reputation. Along the way, the story introduces a number of the most famous figures in Japanese modern and contemporary art from different periods in relation to our broader themes. These distinct generations can be thought of as cohorts who have varying interactions with their global and national contexts, thus revealing how forms of cosmopolitanism and nationhood have changed over time. It also lays a groundwork to understand the problematic evolution of the Japanese modern art tradition and art world institutions and assess the effects of their domination and resistance up to and through into the global art era from the late 1980s onwards. In the second main section, I shift to the younger “post-Bubble” or “zero zero generation” who came of age amidst the economic decline, social malaise and shattering disasters of Japan in the mid-to late 1990s. Their evaluation as emergent artists is not as yet settled-neither in Japan nor internationally. Japan in the 1990s and after experienced economic hardship and global contraction while the rest of the world, in particular the rest of Asia, was going through a development boom. I suggest that this disjuncture with world trends has caused important changes in the dynamics of influence and recognition on the part of these younger Japanese artists in a global context. While they have been largely ignored by the mainstream global art world, the need for the gaisen ko-en in their work is arguably being transcended. The argument is that the qualitative change of Japan from being a rising Asian power and alternate modernity to one pioneering forms of post-Bubble, post-growth society, has largely confounded dominant Western understandings of this new Asian culture. These understandings assume a modernizing developmental paradigm and create their narratives of artistic importance accordingly: essentially in terms of global market value and “political” art theoretical interest-and hence as a “challenge” to the West. But what works for China and India does not work for Japan. Rather, the new post-Bubble generation offers a different way of pinpointing how East Asian society and culture may interact with regional and global forces or embody the national and transnational in a post-growth future. © 2015 Yasemin Nuhoglu Soysal.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087709600

Yet, ironically, the rise of the degrowth movement has coincided with a severe economic recession in the wealthier countries and the result of this does, indeed, seem to have increased hardship and inequity as businesses collapse and jobs are lost (e.g., see JRF 2012).

This paper seeks to foster the cultural transformation of current market-nature relations while retaining the radical core of degrowth. The paper presents an investigative practice that was found in an ethnographic study of an evolving forest-based market in Finland. The practice seems to have the potential to disrupt habitual ways of approaching nature and of turning it into exchangeable and consumable objects. According to practice theory, this kind of disruption creates space for emerging alternatives to the dominant practices.

It is a concept developed based on the theory of sensitivity. It's about the rise of satisfaction, which we understand as aesthetic experience which every individual perceives and creates. Unlike the arts which tend to be predefined and shaped by the past such as architecture, sculpture, painting, music, poetry, etc., the aesthetic experience is another artistic form closer to our daily experiences. Currently this way of understanding the art exists in many Common Places, such as self-run autonomous social centers and urban gardens. To construct an epistemology of this phenomenon in aesthetic study, we must use the paradigm ""symptom-paradigms-styles-examples"", constituting the knowledge from the social context and from the internal analysis about how the thoughts and the actions bring power to all individuals. From this reflection, this essay shows how this social model makes everyone be artist. This paper reconsiders the internal analysis of aesthetic experience through texts and reflections of Hegel, Schiller and Dewey, in which they had previously debated the spirit of the artisan. Finally, I reason how spaces created in this way have a social impact, since lately many ideas related to the concept of Degrowth and ""transition town"" movements have emerged.","Aesthetic experience; Common places; Self-run autonomous social centers; Spirit of artisan; Urban farming",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885047913

Surprisingly, the same mathematical framework of the neoclassical growth model gets to the opposite conclusions - namely that long term growth cannot exceed a level in which nature begins to deplete. Growth further that level as we might experience today leads to natural and economic disaster. Technological progress understood as productivity increase can only delay but not prevent this crisis. We compare these conclusions to the opposite hypothesis of the Environmental Kuznets Curve.

The restoration of global sustainable development will require deep, systemic changes, especially in the world's leading economy, to transition to a new economic system in which the acknowledged priority is to sustain human and natural communities. Policies are available to effect this transformation and to temper economic growth and consumerism while simultaneously improving social well-being and quality of life, but a new politics involving a coalescence of progressive communities is needed to realize these policies. Given the national focus of political action, this article focuses on the US political economy. On the key issue of economic growth, differing positions among American liberals and environmentalists loom, a major barrier to progressive fusion.

However, only in the last decade is this issue re-emerging once again because of the predicaments of climate change and peak oil. Many, finally start to perceive that an ""economic degrowth"" entailing a downscaling of the current size and pattern of socio-economic systems seem unavoidable. In this paper we analyze the implications, the feasibility and the desirability of possible trajectories of downscaling from an energetic perspective. The quantitative analysis is based on the methodological approach of societal metabolism, and it provides a dynamic accounting of the profile of energy flows required and consumed by societies in relation the expression of a given set of societal functions. This analysis makes it possible to check two types of constraints: external constraints (supply and sink side limits for the whole) and internal constraints (the feasibility of energy budget of the various parts of the society expressing the required functions). The analysis of the metabolic pattern of a sample of developed countries is used to discuss possible implications of: (i) demographic changes; (ii) the declining supply of net energy sources, and (iii) the effects of the Jevons' Paradox. Within such an analysis, a few assumptions and recipes of the degrowth movement seem problematic: (i) population is and will remain as a relevant variable to be considered; (ii) the proposed reduction in working hours seem to be impractical unless a major catastrophe will reset current civilization to pre-industrial standards; and (iii) voluntary reduction of personal energy consumption, even if a welcome adjustment, alone will not solve the existing problems. In the final part of the paper, future energetic road maps are questioned within the realm of post-normal science. Can we ""plan"" degrowth? If we are serious about the need of doing ""something completely different"", societies will have to learn how to deliberate under uncertainty within the realms of flexible management and stop planning for either growth or degrowth. Moreover, before suggesting policies, it would be wise first to try to understand the option space. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Realizing environmental limits to and failures of more than half a century of continual economic growth in terms of social progress and environmental sustainability, the degrowth paradigm calls for a downscaling of consumption and production for social equity and ecological sustainability. The call for economic degrowth is generally considered to be delimited to rich countries, where reduced consumption can save ""ecological space"" enabling people in poor countries to enjoy the benefits of economic growth. China, as one of the economically most expanding countries in the world, has dramatically improved its living standards, particularly along the Eastern coast, over the latest 30 years. However, China is absent from the international debates on growth. This article discusses the implications of the Western degrowth debates for China. Given the distinctive features of China's development, the paper aims to enrich the degrowth debates, which have hitherto been dominated by Western perspectives. Based upon reflections on social, environmental, and moral dimensions of economic growth, the paper argues that limited natural resources may not continuously support universal affluence at the current level of the rich countries, a level that China is likely to reach within a few decades. Priority for growth in China should therefore be given to the poor regions of the country, and future growth should be beneficial to social and environmental development. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","China; Degrowth debates; Economic growth; Environmental sustainability; Morality; Social equity","developing world; downscaling; economic development; economic growth; industrialization; living standard; mortality; paradigm shift; socioeconomic status; sustainability; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-82555174407

A common response to this challenge has consisted of research and discourses on governance reform to allow some sort of reconciliation between economic growth and socio-ecological degradation (e.g. ecological modernization, or inclusive/shared growth). In opposition to such reconciliatory responses, sustainable de-growth acknowledges upfront the impossibility and undesirability of continuous growth. As Barry suggests in Chapter 9 (this volume), the ideology of growth, which is structurally coupled with capitalist political economy, is increasingly identified as a major underlying cause of climate change and natural resources depletion. Therefore, a ‘postcapitalist’ political economy perspective is needed that questions economic growth. The least radical de-growth route, often advocated by economists, consists of reforming the dominant economic paradigm. Reform may range from new accounting criteria (that reorient the economy), up to the review of economic paradigms. In either case, the idea is to move away from the goal of ‘maximizing growth at any cost’ and focus instead in achieving broader welfare objectives, such as full employment, eliminating poverty, and protecting the environment (Victor and Rosenbluth 2007). A second route to de-growth, perhaps following the work of Polanyi (2001 [1944]), focuses on neither state nor market-based responses. The idea is that both governments and economies would, and ought to, get embedded within empowered local communities which would grant that these institutions work along authentically democratic principles. In this vein, social scientists, including some economists (perhaps regretting some of their professional choices), assert that the transition to de-growth cannot be left to economists or representative governments. Rather, the embedding of the economy into democracy is envisioned as the outcome of political struggle, led by coalitions of social/environmental movements (Martinez-Alier 2009). A comprehensive deployment of this argument is Speth’s (2008) call for reinvigorating democracy from below in its deliberative and participatory forms, rather than seeking to direct change from above. Unfortunately, it is unclear how and why people will disengage from consumerism and take on the burden of democratically designing the rules of the economy. One may argue that there is already an increasing number of people who are deeply concerned about the urgency of climate change and the unfairness of the economy, but this painful realization does not lead them to take any significant action or engage in organized movements (Fournier 2008). Therefore, significant doubts can be cast over the capacity of a de-growth movement to emerge in the short run and wage an ideological struggle against the power of a hegemonic macro-structure, which has emerged from the interplay between market economy, capitalist production conditions, and representative democracy. This macro-structure is tremendously sturdy and confers stability to the tyranny of growth both ideologically and practically, while at the same time depending on this very tyranny for its reproduction. A third route proposes ‘inclusive democracy’ as a universalist project for human liberation and autonomy. Drawing on libertarian thought, this route postulates a fundamental incompatibility between liberal market economies and degrowth (Fotopoulos 2007). Accordingly, strategies based on changing behaviour, democratic reform, or radical decentralization are not seen as effective, or even realistic, because they do not address either power relations, or the historical characteristics of capitalism, which are both structurally linked to the need for continuous growth. Therefore, a pre-condition for de-growth is a more egalitarian distribution of power, which would result from a confederation of communities functioning according to principles of economic equality, collective ownership, and direct democracy. Again, the means, or praxis, to achieve this organizational vision is the crucial issue. Inclusive democracy does point to a conscious and self-reflective choice for autonomy (over heteronomy) as a driving force towards de-growth. Perhaps following Hegel, Fotopoulos (1997: 181) situates this choice in the dialectical tension between individual versus collective, agency versus structure, or idealism versus materialism. The origin of this tension is situated in the fact that individuals are both free to create their world and at the same time are created by the world. According to Fotopoulos (2000), the way out of this tension is a liberatory project towards individual and collective autonomy that synthesizes democratic, socialist, libertarian, green and feminist traditions. In this chapter I discuss the usefulness of the concept of alienation in the study of growth. This exploration is based in bibliographic and ethnographic research that sought to reconstruct life-story narratives (see Bruner 2004) of agents promoting tourist growth. The development of two adjacent coastal enclaves in the Mexican Caribbean, a region subjected to intense tourist commoditization, is compared to illustrate the usefulness and difficulties of researching alienation. © 2012 Selection and editorial matter: Mark Pelling, David Manuel-Navarrete and Michael Redclift; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128576414

From a theoretical perspective, this paper critically discusses the potentials of different decoupling mechanisms to counteract the eco-destructive effects of housing sector and economic growth. The mechanisms by which housing-related environmental impacts can be decoupled from economic growth are: substituting for growth in the housing sector, increasing the economic value of the housing stock via qualitative improvement, and improving eco-efficiency of residential buildings. These decoupling strategies are subject to limitations, and the technological, political and social presuppositions for the operation of the decoupling mechanisms in order to reach a sufficient level of decoupling degree seem to be difficult to meet. A transition from the growth paradigm to degrowth is necessary for environmental sustainability, and proper policies should be in place for a socially sustainable degrowth. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Decoupling; Degrowth; Economic growth; Environmental sustainability; Housing sector",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872383471

Its etymology means dharmic management with the main idea of using sparingly, taking the right share. Actual economic paradigm, lifeblind and greedy, is contradictory with these dharmic aspects. Green economy and responsible practices are also showing limitations to achieve sustainability. They are not in tune with the need to reduce material throughput as expressed by the Club of Rome 40 years ago and advocated by steady state economists and degrowth movement. A sustainable paradigm of management clearly needs to affirm its responsibility towards society and recognize the central role of nature. Four sustainability principles have been scientifically defined, based on laws of Nature and Physics. In such a challenge, only spiritual values can help. Spirituality which is positively associated to individual and organizational well-being certainly brings more righteousness and altruism through life interconnectedness, vision, and compassion. It indicates the way to material reduction with values such as non-violence, non-acquisitiveness and contentment. Indian tradition prescribed the balancing of four purusharthas - dharma, artha, kama & moksha - as an ideal way of directing oneself which automatically led to an ethical life, both individually and collectively. It is perhaps time to have a re-look at this model in order to draw lessons for modern management. Even though this new paradigm seems utopian, there is a potential to empower compassionate/altruistic managers. Spirituality may strengthen managers on certain life skills such as decision making, empathy, coping with emotions and stress. A recent study has shown that students who are highly spiritual and religious have a better perception of their psychological, social and cognitive skills. This potential needs to be studied more thoroughly to identify how spirituality is creating favorable circumstances to achieve sustainability.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865355044

Yet, it is simultaneously a policy failure given the continued growth in the environmental impacts of tourism in absolute terms. This paper analyses sustainable tourism, and the governance systems for sustainable tourism, via the concepts of policy learning and failure. The tractability of sustainable tourism policy problems is identified. Policy learning is discussed in instrumental, conceptual/paradigmatic and political learning/strategic terms. Although policy failure should encourage learning with respect to sustainable tourism this has only related to first- and second-order change which focus on changes to indicators and settings rather than the dominant policy paradigm. This is despite the dominant paradigm of ""balanced"" sustainable development that promotes economic growth failing on a number of indicators. A reason for this may be the unwillingness of key actors in tourism policy networks to acknowledge policy failure. The paper concludes that although exogenous factors such as a crisis event may lead to policy paradigmatic change, there is insufficient evidence that such a shift in sustainable tourism policy will necessarily occur given the entrenched dominance of the existing paradigm. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Degrowth; Economic growth; Environmental change; Institutional norms; Liberal environmentalism; Steady-state tourism","economic growth; ecotourism; environmentalism; governance approach; learning; policy analysis; policy implementation; sustainable development; tourism development; tourism management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959370957

Another is that degrowth may not be an effective, let alone an efficient strategy to reduce environmental pressure. It is subsequently argued that ""a-growth,"" i.e. being indifferent about growth, is a more logical social aim to substitute for the current goal of economic growth, given that GDP (per capita) is a very imperfect indicator of social welfare. In addition, focusing ex ante on public policy is considered to be a strategy which ultimately is more likely to obtain the necessary democratic-political support than an ex ante, explicit degrowth strategy.

However, despite the plethora of publications, conferences, and strategies that deal with sustainability, tourism is arguably less sustainable than it has ever been. The reasons for this are several-fold and include the relative weakness of sustainability research in tourism as an epistemic community; economic, institutional and political barriers; and the inherent problems of the concept in terms of its capacity to marry social, environmental and economic indicators, and the addiction to economic growth. Following an outline of the expansion of tourism’s contribution to global environmental change the article provides a re-conceptualization of sustainable tourism from an ecological economics perspective. From this approach sustainable tourism development is understood as tourism development without growth in throughput of matter and energy beyond regenerative and absorptive capacities. Steady-state tourism is, therefore, a tourism system that encourages qualitative development but not aggregate quantitative growth to the detriment of natural capital. In the case of tourism, more does not mean better, and growth does not mean development. Tourism policy implications are also examined. It is concluded that while the political-economic indications for such a transformative approach are not immediately encouraging, the environmental necessity is stronger than ever. © 2010 Tourism Recreation Research.","Degrowth; Ecological economics; Epistemic community; Global environmental change; Steady-state tourism; Sustainable tourism",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979929951

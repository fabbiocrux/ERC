This approach consists of understanding cities as the result of a specific socio-ecological regime, no longer solely through their functions or activities, but through their flows and stocks of materials and resources. Many cities have taken up the resource management discourse to design circular economy action plans, which aim to reduce urban environmental impacts while generating new jobs, social well-being and room for innovation. Indeed, cities worldwide are committed to becoming more circular in their resource use, but whether or not their actions help them to reduce their environmental impacts is unclear. <!-- Circular Economy blindness --> Particularly, the main deep challengue lies in the bridging the boundaries of urban and production systems as towards a one coherent, continuum and multi-scale design process <span class="citation" data-cites="ref">[@ref]</span>.</p>

<p>To appreciate the ground-breaking scientific nature of this idea, let me state that the plastic production increased at compound annual growth rate of 8.4%, passing from <span class="math inline">\(2Mt\)</span> in 1950 to <span class="math inline">\(368Mt\)</span> in 2019, but about 9% have been recycled while 79% was accumulated in landfills or the natural environment <span class="citation" data-cites="Geyer2017">[@Geyer2017]</span>. Historically, the plastic recycling has been oriented to centralized facilities in order to take advantage of economies of scale through the production of low-value products. However, it is proved to be an expensive process due to the inherent separate collection, transportation, processing and remanufacturing <span class="citation" data-cites="Hopewell2009 Singh2017b">[@Hopewell2009; @Singh2017b]</span>. <!-- Explaining DRAM --> On the other hand, DRAM can starts with local plastic waste that is produced everywhere from packaging to broken products (<em>Recovery (I)</em>). It is washed, dried and then ground or cut into particles using a waste plastic granulator or office shredder (<em>Preparation (II)</em>). <!-- From filament --> The raw material for FFF can be manufactured economically using distributed means with a waste plastic extruder (often called a “recyclebot”)<span class="citation" data-cites="Baechler2013">[@Baechler2013]</span> for mono or composite materials (<em>Compounding (II) and Feedstock (IV)</em>). Filament made with a recyclebot costs less than 10 cents per kg, whereas commercial filament costs $20/kg or more. This can produce valuable products at remarkably low costs. For example, using a recyclebot/3D-printer combination can produce over 300 units (e.g., camera lens hoods) for the price of one such item listed on marketplaces (e.g.&nbsp;Amazon). <!-- FGF --> Fused granular fabrication is a recent experimental approach enabling the printing process directly from pellets <span class="citation" data-cites="JustinoNetto2021 netto2022">[@JustinoNetto2021;@netto2022]</span>, which reduces the degradation cycles of the plastic. For this process, I worked in the desktop format <span class="citation" data-cites="Arthur2020">[@Arthur2020]</span>, but it seems that this technology could further expand the boundaries of additive manufacturing and eventually recycling <span class="citation" data-cites="billah2021 Reich2019 Byard2019">[@billah2021; @Reich2019;@Byard2019]</span> for larger object <span class="citation" data-cites="petsiuk2022">[@petsiuk2022]</span>. <!-- Advantages --></p>
<!-- OPen source approach -->
<p>Distributed recycling fits into the circular economy paradigm <span class="citation" data-cites="Zhong2018 Garmulewicz2018 Despeisse2016">[@Zhong2018; @Garmulewicz2018; @Despeisse2016]</span>, as it eliminates most embodied energy and pollution from transportation between processing steps. Also, it decreases the embodied energy of filament by 90% compared to traditional centralized filament manufacturing using fossil fuels as inputs <span class="citation" data-cites="Kreiger2013 Zhong2017 Horta2017">[@Kreiger2013; @Zhong2017;@Horta2017]</span>. <!-- Open source --> Additionaly, open-source investment should result in an extremely high return on investment (ROI)<span class="citation" data-cites="Pearce2020a">[@Pearce2020a]</span>. This makes distributed recycling environmentally superior to other methods of plastic recycling systems.</p>
<p><!-- From logistical --> However, I realized that the global system maturity is ambiguous given that not all the value chain for the implementation of a community-driven of plastic recycling are matured <span class="citation" data-cites="CruzSanchez2020">[@CruzSanchez2020]</span>. <!-- Materials --> Major efforts in the scientific literature have been only concentrated in the materials and technical validation.<br>
However, the system validation remains to be difficult to implement.

<!-- Introduction of the project court -->
<p>This project implements a methodology made of four working packages (WP), as illustrated in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:WPs}\)</span>. We recognize appropriate intermediate objectives (Tasks) and we individuate the specific interventions of the members of the research team. Moreover, we discuss the particular methodologies that we plan to adopt and we make a balance among the risks and gains associated to each action. <!-- We also propose suitable exit strategies in the eventuality that the risk related to a specific activity results to be excessively high. --> <!-- WP1: Cricuit court --> The aim of WP1 is to set a baseline for an integrative and critical analysis of urban territory in the frame of micro-value chains for manufacturing/recycling production. This working package gives the insights for the WP2, and WP3, which are key of the project. <!-- WP2 --> The WP2 seeks to consolidate systematize a design process for OSAT for a complete distributed manufacturing/recycling process establishing an unit maturity level index, but more important, a system maturity level for the integration into an urban ecosystem. <!-- Output --> The main output is to establish a complete OSAT design framework ecosystems to valorize the waste niches opportunities identified in WP1. <!-- WP3 --> The WP3 aims to identify a pluralistic (e)valuation framework for the urban closed-loop system network integrating three essential issues: sustainability, resiliency, and agility into a circular economy praxis. <!-- WP4 --> Finally, WP4 is dedicated to the experimentation of the several case studies of the urban circular manufacturing taking as exemple into at case studies the implementation of the Green Fablab Project at the third place of OK3 at Nancy-France. The object is to replicate this analysis in other territories such Chile, in collaboration with Prof.&nbsp;Pavlo Santander at the university of Santiago de Chile, and in Canada with collaboration of Prof.&nbsp;Joshua Pearce at Western University. Work packages are synthetically detailed hereinafter. <!-- Close --> Work packages are synthetically detailed hereinafter.</p>

<p>The monitoring and assessing material consumption and material productivity is critical, both from a macroeconomic perspective —to assess whether sufficient action has been taken, as well as from a local perspective— to support local decision makers in setting new priorities toward long-term objectives <span class="citation" data-cites="Bianchi2020">[@Bianchi2020]</span>. <!-- Diagnosis --> The goal is to define a <em>{territory x material}</em> index from a quantitative approach and urban metabolism to study resource use in a urban city. This assessment aims to quantify hotspots (availability and level of contamination) based on territorial and footprint indicators and assess scenarios for the design of a recycling closed-loop supply chain. For the case of plastic material, this is particularly relevant given ambitious circularity targets that certain governments have putting in place <span class="citation" data-cites="france">[@france]</span> due to the their impact. <!-- Final output --> The priority is to reveal a list of ‘suitable’ secondary materials wastes at the urban level that today are not fully understood and valorized. This analysis will be carried out at least every year, and if possible more frequently to see if there is a change or seasonality in the composition of this untreated waste.</p>

<p>Human life and activities rely on ecosystem services (ES) provided by nature. The ecosystem services are the ecological characteristics, functions or processes that contribute (actively or passively) to the human well-being <span class="citation" data-cites="Costanza1997 Costanza2017">[@Costanza1997; @Costanza2017]</span>. Ecosystem goods (e.g; Food) and services (e.g.&nbsp;waste assimilation) illustrate the benefits that human derive from the ecosystem functions <span class="citation" data-cites="Costanza1997">[@Costanza1997]</span>. The ecosystem services do not flow to human well-being without crucial interactions with the different forms of capital (Natural, Social, Human, Built), which entails the need of understanding, modelling, measuring, and managing ES in a transdisciplinary approach. Likewise, the concept of ecosystem dis-service denotes the processes and functions that affect humans in ‘negative’ way, making damage and costs <span class="citation" data-cites="ref">[@ref]</span>. With the concentration of people and activities in cities, these services are intensively utilized in urban space to an extent that in most cases cannot be provided by the local ecosystem. Thus, cities (and urban factories) have to rely on supply regions and connection to their hinterland. One major point that ES make clear is to raise awareness on the recognition of interdependence of human, humanity’s primary dependances on the ‘functions of’ natural capital which reflects the fact that, however they may perceive themselves, humans are part of, and not apart from, nature <span class="citation" data-cites="Ekins2003">[@Ekins2003]</span>. This entails the necessity to create knowledge for transdisciplinary approaches using ES as boundary object for sustainability for diverse stakeholders <span class="citation" data-cites="Honeck2021">[@Honeck2021]</span>.</p>
<!-- Starting poit -->
<p>As starting point, we will analyze the sites and the territories concerned by the Green Fablab project, namely the urban community of “Grand Nancy” (CUGN). We benefit from the support of the municipality and the recognition of the project in the local area. <!-- Tasks --> We will be able to perform a field diagnosis of this territory to map and characterize the existing stakeholders needs, a SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) including technical, economic and environmental evaluations of the existing value chains, to understand where the value chain could be positioned in the future. <!-- Possible output --> This test is the first step to possible replicate the analysis for other terrotories.</p>

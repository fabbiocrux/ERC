## DRAM in a nutshell

The aim of DRAM is to establish a blueprint methodology for the implementation of micro-chain values of distributed recycling at a urban territorial level.
We seek to the achievement of a three-level target: (1) Undertand the establishment of a free-open source technical ecosystem that can be printed, 2) to establish a set indicators to possible help decision-makers and in the local implementation of these initiatives in Europe/(America?), 3) .....

### Plastics and the Antropocene: a change is needed
<!-- Intro -->
Plastic waste contamination is one of the relevant stratigraphic indicator of what is recently considered the Anthropocene era [@de-la-torre2021]. 
   <!-- Anthropocene: Popularized by the chemist Paul Crutzen in 2000 -->
The anthropocene frames the humans not only as biological but as geological force acknowledging the new status of humanity given the different markups in the ecosystems that are impacting the stability of the earth system.
   <!-- Consequence of  -->
The current globalized manufacturing activities have played a major role not only as motor for the economic development, but also the transgression of the planetary boundaries [@ONeill2018].
   <!-- Features of antropocene -->
For instance, the plastic production increased at compound annual growth rate of 8.4%, passing from  $2Mt$ in 1950 to $368Mt$ in 2019, but about 9% have been recycled  while 79% was accumulated in landfills or the natural environment [@Geyer2017]. 
   <!-- Major plastic problematic -->
Soil and marine plastic pollution shows ecological, biogeochemical and physical thresholds and they are becoming a key component of the planetary boundary threat associated with chemical pollutants.
   <!-- European Union Perspective  -->
   <!-- Paradox  -->
The delay that implies to put in place an alternative productive model is the main the paradox in this issue. 
This implies the scientific questions on how to manage the huge amount of waste already present in the nature and the plastic waste generated in the short term expecting that materials science and industrial corpus develops feedstock in corcordance with the bio-geological cycles.
   <!-- changes in demography -->
<!-- This is impulsed by the population increased from 3 to 6 billion since 1950, while the leap in economic activity  increased of 15-fold over that period, which is even more critical [@steffen2011].  -->
Indeed, the rebound effect of the global mass production paradigm demands to rethink the paradigms of the means of production given the ecological degradation.

### Getting stuck with the scale paradigm for recycling 
   <!-- Validation of the Mechanical recycling -->
Different routes have been developed for plastic recycling (see Figure)

From an energy and environmental perspective, the scientific literature [@Arena2003, @Perugini2005, @Lazarevic2010, @Piemonte2011] proves that the mechanical recycling strategy is the most suitable plastic waste management option for relatively clean and homogeneous plastic and bioplastic waste streams compared to landfilling or incineration alternatives.  
   <!-- THe problem of mechanical recycling -->
However, transitioning to sustainable plastics in the manufacturing of plastic products, parts, and packaging is influenced by the complex interconnections between polymer producers - petrochemical companies- [10], converters [11], brand owners or manufacturers [12], retailers and consumers [13], and recycling operators [14], as well as the influences of policymakers in wider economic and societal changes [11].
Economic, social, political and technological barriers must be overcome for sustainable plastic management [9]. 



### Major long vision: Circular and convivial production
Today, a major societal issue rely on how to conceived socio-technical 'circular units' for manufacturing that include all ecosystem externalitites considering the carrying capacity of the ecosystem.

There is a need to understand  in the fuzzy front-end design of socio-technical systems for sustainability transitions [@]
   <!-- Urban lives -->
Indeed, the trend is reinforced by the fact that by 2050, it is expected that about 70% of the world's population will live in urban settlements [@savini2021].
Urban cities will be responsible for non-negligible environmental impact, producing about 50% of global waste, and 75% of greenhouse gas emissions which affects the sustainability of cities and the quality of city life [@Riffat2016].
<!-- And certainly, the rebound effect of plastic materials will be the case. -->
The manufacturing and de-, re-cycling approaches will need to converge in a post-growth economy context need to integrate the related societal issues of resource scarcity and waste accumulation in the urban settlements [@kallis2018; @savini2021].

### Open source and digital commons for 'Design global / Manufacturing local'
As an alternative of globalized manufacturing values chains,
   <!-- Presenting distributed approach -->
a major trend in the development of production systems seeks to establish an urban production model with decentralized and distributed characteristics [@Herrmann2020].
   <!-- DGML -->
Aiming at a 'design global / manufacturing local' seems a proto-industrialization [@sabel1985] transition that is taking place in urban settlements that could a major impact in the next short future [@].
   <!-- FOSH and P2P -->
The Open Source Appropriate Technology (OSAT) and P2P approaches have been seen potential drivers to propose an alternative globalisation manufacturing paradigm [@Heikkinen2020a].
<!-- Additive manufacturing -->
The open source additive manufacturing technology, also know as 3D printing, have played a major role in the idea of democratization of manufacturing means [@]. 
<!-- Examples of distributed change -->
Thousands of open-source products are shared by the global community from consumer goods to scientific[@] and medical equipment[@]. 
This model has been proven to be effective for emergency manufacturing during the COVID-19 pandemic [@Pearce2020a].
This is a driver communities to fabricate their own products for less than the price of purchasing them. 
<!-- Towards Urban factory -->
In that sense, the concept of urban factory is evolving as a disruptive approach and is the materialization of this manufacturing paradigm.
The urban factory is defined as "*a factory located in an urban environment that is actively utilizing the unique characteristics of its surroundings*".
It creates products with a focus on the local market and allows customer involvement during value creation [@Herrmann2020; @Ijassi2022]. 

### Distributed recycling for additive manufacturing: a promising inclusion
<!-- My major goal -->
Since 2014, I have been working on the validation of the open-source 3D printing as a robust manufacturing system [@CruzSanchez2014], but also as a potential enabler of the mechanical recycling [@Cruz2015;@CruzSanchez2017] of plastic waste material.
   <!-- Promise -->
Distributed recycling (See @fig-DRAM)  is a breakthrough promise in the constitution of a micro-circular industry units to validate the technical feasibility, and several technologic pathways are maturing to allow individuals to recycle waste plastic directly by 3D-printing it into valuable products.

### DRAM: why now?
To appreciate the ground-breaking scientific nature of this idea, let me state that
<!-- Explaining DRAM -->
the most adopted form of additive manufacturing is fused filament fabrication, which is a material extrusion process [@]. 
DRAM starts with waste plastic that is produced everywhere from packaging to broken products. 
It is washed, dried and then ground or cut into particles using a waste plastic granulator or office shredder. 
Next, the particles are either converted to 3D-printing filament using a recyclebot or printed directly. 
Filament made with a recyclebot costs less than 10 cents per kg, whereas commercial filament costs $20/kg or more. 
This can produce valuable products at remarkably low costs.
For example, using a recyclebot/3D-printer combination can produce over 300 units (e.g., camera lens hoods) for the price of one such item listed on Amazon.com.
   <!-- From filament -->
The raw material for FFF can be manufactured economically using distributed means with a waste plastic extruder (often called a “recyclebot”) [@Baechler2013]. 
Recycling of plastic waste into 3-D printing filament decreases the embodied energy of filament by 90% compared to traditional centralized filament manufacturing using fossil fuels as inputs [@Kreiger2013; @Zhong2017].
   <!-- OPen source approach -->
Distributed recycling fits into the circular economy paradigm [@Zhong2018; @Garmulewicz2018; @Despeisse2016], as it eliminates most embodied energy and pollution from transportation between processing steps.
<!-- Open source -->
Additionaly, open-source investment should result in an extremely high return on investment (ROI) in free and open source hardware [@ref]. 
This makes distributed recycling and additive manufacturing (DRAM) environmentally superior to other methods of plastic recycling.

   <!-- From logistical -->
However, from a scientific perspective using a systematic literature review, I realized that the global system maturity the technical value chain for the implementation of a community-driven of plastic recycling is ambiguous [@CruzSanchez2020].
Major efforts in the scientific literature have been only concentrated in the materials and technical validation.  
However, the system validation remains to be difficult to implement. 
More in deep, the analysis of the holistic impact that this process can have in the context of a city remain vague, if not, not treated at all.

   <!-- From logistical -->
Moreover, I have been leading the implementation of the demostrator in the framework of an European project. which is a sustaiability trasition for the urban plastic in a living lab approach.


   <!-- RRI Industry -->




   <!-- RRI Industry -->
In particular, this will is important if a recycled resources industry (RRI) is starting to conceived inside the cities.
RRI is seen as driver consists of a series of activities related to recycled resources -- e.g., recycling, refining, remanufacturing, etc. -- aspiring to mitigate the negative externality caused by the linear economy [@wang2019b]. 
   <!-- Circular society -->
The sustainable development of the RRI has thus been highlighted on many countries' agendas to promote the circular society [@leipold2021; @hobson2021;@jaeger-erben2021a], as well as the goals of carbon peak and carbon neutralization.
   <!-- Affordability  -->
The main difficulty remains to make affordable the use of new secondary material applicability by the industry [@klotz2022], but at the end, for urban planning and polycimaking to make concrete the ambition of circuclar economy inside the urban and regional settlements.

## 2. Ambition & objectives 

<!-- Delightlinh the problem -->
 
Plastic waste issue remains a systemic problem, and it calls for pushing forward the boundaries of knowledge    in the fuzzy front-end design phases socio-technical configurations.
There is a urgent necessity to better understand how to implement a socio-technical interventions  to unleash a sustainability transition towards appropriate and inclusive micro-recycling values chains inspired on the "Design Global / Manufacturing local" principles*.
<!-- Axis -->
By exploring the distributed recycling via additive manufacturing niche, 
<!-- Main objectives -->
**the purpose of SDRAM project is create a systemic blueprint methodological approach to fully expand the frontiers of the socio-technical systems of distributed recycling for additive manufacturing as a sustainable transitions in urban settlements.**
   <!-- Unpacking the problem objectives -->
To do so, the SDRAM project aims to deep understanding of the socio-technical configurations connecting three major layers: 
1) open technological assets, 2) filière, 
and 3) pluralism indicators in the case of urban transitions. 
   <!-- Ambition -->
The ambition of this project is to open up the possibilities of a new field of socio-technical axis of  distributed recycling  to the scientific community.


<!-- Pushing fortwards the frontiers -->

### A challenging task for a systemic blueprint
<!-- GAp to comble objectives -->
The major gap that currently prevents from exploring the potential of distributed recycling relies on a missing a holistic understanding of the design for sustainability [@Ceschin2016; @SousaRocha2019] of socio-technical system.
This implies going from the technical (molecule , process unit) to the ecosystem impact of the implementation. 
   <!-- Explaining the work -->
As a systemic blueprint, I aim to make linkage of the micro-meso-macro levels of the technical, system and valuation layers embeed in a spatio-temporal context (See Figure XX)



<!-- in a context of ‘Spaceship Earth’, as an apt metaphor to chart the boundaries for a safe planet [@sterner2019]. -->


<!-- Gaps in the literature -->

   <!-- OSAT -->
- \textit{\underline{The open-source appropriatte technology as a technological has just started}}.
In this project, the technological choices and applications that are small-scale, economically affordable, decentralised, energy-efficient, environmentally sound and easily utilized by local communities to meet their needs is fundamental[@]. 
Therefore, the trend in appropriate technologies is towards relatively simple and non-complex technologies, to complete the technological mix to be capable of plastic recycling from the identification of material, cleaning, sorting.
The development of open hardware scietnific are considered as an excellent choice to reduce the cost [@]. 
The creation of a technical blueprint is  there is no a database that include
 is regarded as the front of 
A complete technological mix aims to empower citizen in the.
to To identify the pertinent The establishment of development of a technological open source maturity level focalised on the distributed recycling  of the  design of an open source appropriate technical ecosystem (OSAT).

   <!-- Socio -->
- \textit{\underline{Systemic design thinking is needed to identify major feedbacks in the strategic, the tactical and the operational decisional levels}}.
Reconciling urban development and industrial development is not an easy task. 
Thus, the type of information that decision-makers take into account is relevant at the moment to put in place industrial systems.


- \textit{\underline{Pluralism valuation for emerging industrial micro-values chains that integrate ecosystem characteristics.}} 
From the ecological economics science, it is stated to analys socio-technical sytems beyond the economics [@], to include new form of pluralims valuation to include the ecological interactions[@].

<!-- Complexities of Plastics -->

    <u>underscored text </u>

I like to highligth that historically, the plastic recycling has been oriented to centralized facilities in order to take advantage of economies of scale through the production of low-value products.
However, it is proved to be an expensive process due to the inherent separate collection, transportation, processing and remanufacturing [@Hopewell2009; @Singh2017b].
The consequence is for high volume and low weight polymers, the recycling of plastic is not cost-efficient in a centralized context.
<!-- Deeping in the problem of recycling --> In fact, if we currently consider the sources of plastic waste and more specifically those from food packaging, we are faced with various limitations related to the types of material and their shaping.
<!-- Sorting centers G1 --> More specifically, Taking the French case, the sorting centers find themselves with 3 material flows to manage.
<!-- Group 1 --> The first group (G1), namely that of bottles and flasks, is well controlled with relatively distributed sorting throughout the French territory (about 150 sites) and centralized mechanical recycling in a few specialized centres by type of plastic (polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), high density PE (HDPE) PET).
<!-- G2 --> For the second group (G2: i.e. refusal of sorting PET, PP, PET/ HDPE mixture, polystyrene polyethylene (PS)), following the many actions carried out in recent years, we find ourselves with sorted plastics but due to a lack of circuit and value chain only residual energy value is considered although their properties are still high.
<!-- G3 --> Finally, the third group (G3: i.e. biopolymers, polylactic acid (PLA), Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA)) consists of unsorted plastics that end up in landfills and on which we have very little information \[17\].

### Rebound problem: democratization of the waste

The reduction of the dependence of oil-based materials, as plastics, is a systemic endeavor challengue.
However, there is an plastic waste stock of 70 years of accumulation of plastics materials.
If the prot-systems of 'design global / manufacturing local' continues to be democratized, **we'll probably leading to a future with a rebound effect of waste.**

<!-- Levels of analysis -->

Considering the different specificities of AM processes, a broad field of opportunity is emerging to develop more sustainable means of production at different levels of the value chain [@Despeisse2016].

### Preliminary studies on the use of rec

-   The use of recycled materials like polymer waste is going to be one of the stock that we"ll nedd to use given the scarcity of
-   Assitive manufacturing is a potential enabler of change for manufacturing
-   the community-base recycling approach is a scale of the changes
-   major efforts in the implementation of community-driven recycling approach is needed in the urban settlements
-   the proposition of system dynamics as modelisation tool to understand the the main gap in ecosystems services are needed in the ) like a bacterias, we need to develop a industrial infrastructure that stimulus the regenerative use of products
-   Validation of open source as a means to foster the manufacturing conviviality
-   Resilience as a major backtrack for industrial processes in the future
-   Pluralism forms of evaluation needs to be developed to evaluate the implementation strategies of community-drivesn strategies of manufacturing.\
-   Mechanical recycling is leading a path in the transformation of waste-to-ressource atoms
-   

towards the distributed recycling via additive manufacturing approach[@CruzSanchez2020], validating the open source 3D printing as a reliable technique process.
This validation of the process have also include the polymer recycling process as a possible industrial vector that enables can give possible uses to this abundant material.

Studies on the technical viability of recycled materials as substitutes for conventional virgin materials are still limited to particular applications [@Mikula2020].
We have proved that for prototyping is the case [@ref].
We need to imagine that the use of recycled assets becomes a norm and not a exception in the industrial process.
This is important given that in a post-growth appproachs, the rarefication of virgin assets is a plausible scenario.
